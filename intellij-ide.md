The plugins for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) provide a
fully integrated development experience in the IntelliJ IDE.

## Installation and setup

Please follow the [Flutter setup](/setup/) instructions to install IntelliJ and
the Dart and Flutter plugins.

### Updating the plugins<a name="updating"/>

Updates to the plugins will be shipped on a regular basis. You should get
prompted in IntelliJ when an update is available.

To check for updates manually:

1. Open preferences (**IntelliJ IDEA>Check for Updates...** on macOS,
**Help>Check for Updates...** on Linux).

1. If `dart` or `flutter` are listed, update them.

## Creating projects

### Creating a new project

To create a new Flutter IntelliJ project from the Flutter starter app template:

1. In IntelliJ, click **Create New Project** from the 'Welcome' window or
**File>New>Project...** from the main IDE window.

1. Select **Flutter** in the menu, and click **Next**.

1. Enter your desired **Project name** and **Project location**.

1. Click **Finish**.

### Creating a new project from existing source code

To create a new Flutter IntelliJ project containing existing Flutter source code
files:

1. In IntelliJ, click **Create New Project** from the 'Welcome' window or
**File>New>Project...** from the main IDE window.
  - **Note**: Do *not* use the **New>Project from existing sources...** option for Flutter projects.

1. Select **Flutter** in the menu, and click **Next**.

1. Under **Project location** enter, or browse to, the directory holding your
existing Flutter source code files.

1. Click **Finish**.

## Editing code, and viewing code problems

The Dart plugin performs code analysis that enables:

* Syntax highlighting.

* Code completions based on rich type analysis.

* Navigating to type declarations (**Navigate>Declaration**), and finding type
 usages (**Edit>Find>Find Usages**).

* Viewing all current source code problems (**View>Tool Windows>Dart Analysis**).
Any analysis issues will be shows in the Dart Analysis pane:

## Running and Debugging

Running and Debugging is controlled from the main toolbar:

![Main IntelliJ toolbar](/images/intellij/main-toolbar.png)

### Selecting a target

When a Flutter project is open in IntelliJ, you should see a set of Flutter
specific buttons on the right-hand side of the toolbar.

1. Locate the **Flutter Device Selector** drop-down button. This will show a
 list of available targets. Select the target you want your app to started on.

* When you connect devices, or start simulators, additional entries will appear.

### Run app in release mode

1. Click the **Play icon** in the toolbar, or invoke **Run>Run**.

* The bottom **Run** pane will show logs output:

![Log pane](/images/intellij/log.png)

### Run app in debug mode

1. If desired, set breakpoints in your source code.

1. Click the **Debug icon** in the toolbar, or invoke **Run>Debug**.

* The bottom **Debugger** pane will show Stack Frames and Variables.

* The bottom **Console** pane will show detailed logs output.

* Debugging is based on a default launch configuration. To customize this, click.
 the drop-down button to the right of the device selector, and select **Edit configuration**.

### Advanced debugging with Observatory

Observatory is an additional debugging and profiling tool presented with an
html-based UI. For details see the [Observatory page](https://dart-lang.github.io/observatory/).

To open Observatory:

1. Run your app in debug mode.

1. In the Debug panel at the bottom, click the **Arrow icon** ('Open Observatory').

## Fast edit and refresh development cycle

Flutter offers a best-in-class developer cycle enabling you to see the effect of
your changes near instantly.

![Hot reload in IntelliJ](/images/intellij/hot-reload.gif)

To edit your code and hot reload changes:

1. Run your app in debug mode.

1. Make desired changes in your source code (without stopping the debugger).

1. In the Debug panel at the bottom, click the **Hot Reload button**.

### IntelliJ keyboard shortcuts

**Hot Reload**

On Linux (IntelliJ keymap _Default for XWin_) the keyboard shortcut is CTRL+F5.

On macOS (IntelliJ keymap _Mac OS X 10.5+ copy_) the keyboard shortcut is ⌘F5,
which unfortunately is already mapped to _macOS VoiceOver_. The Flutter team is
[working on better default
keybindings](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/335). For now
you can remap the keybinding through the IntelliJ settings as shown below.

**Full Application Restart**

On Linux (IntelliJ keymaps _Default for XWin_) the keyboard shortcut is
CTRL+Shift+F5.

On macOS (IntelliJ keymap _Mac OS X 10.5+ copy_) the keyboard shortcut is ⇧⌘F5.

Keyboard mappings can be changed in IntelliJ Preferences/Settings: Select
*Keymap*, then enter _flutter_ into the search box in the upper right corner.
Right click the binding you want to change and _Add Keyboard Shortcut_.

### 'Hot Reloads' vs 'Full Application Restarts'

Hot Reload works by injecting updated source code files into the running Dart VM
(Virtual Machine). This includes not only adding new classes, but also adding
methods and fields to existing classes, and changing existing functions. A few
types of code changes cannot be hot reloaded though:

* Global variable initializers.

* Static field initializers.

* The `main()` method of the app.

For these changes you can fully restart your application, without having to end
your debugging session:

1. In the Debug panel at the bottom, click the **Full Application Restart button**
(shown with an icon containing a circular arrow).

## Tips and tricks

Keyboard shortcuts:
  * JetBrains has a good [Keyboard Shortcuts You Cannot Miss](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/keyboard-shortcuts-you-cannot-miss.html) overview
  * Customize the shortcuts to your preferences in **Preferences > Keymap**

To navigate quickly in your code:
  * Switch between recently edited files with `cmd-e`
  * Navigate between all files with `cmd-arrow_up`

Code completion:
  * Code completions will be shown as you type, or can be invoked at any time with `shift-spacebar`
  * IntelliJ code completion matches are per-default case sensitive, even on the first letter. 
    You can change this in **Preferences > Editor > General > Code Completion**

## Troubleshooting
