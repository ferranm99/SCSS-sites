## Create the app

Use the `flutter create` command to create a new project:

```terminal
$ flutter create myapp
$ cd myapp
```

The command creates a Flutter project directory called `myapp` that
contains a simple demo app that uses
[Material Components](https://material.io/guidelines/).

In the project directory, the code for your app is in `lib/main.dart`.

## Run the app

 1. Check that an Android device is running. If none are shown, see
    [setup](/get-started/install).

    ```terminal
    $ flutter devices
    ```

 2. Run the app with the `flutter run` command:

    ```terminal
    $ flutter run
    ```
