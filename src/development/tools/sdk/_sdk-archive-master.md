## Master channel

Installation bundles are not available for master. However, you can get the SDK
directly from [GitHub repo]({{site.repo.flutter}}) by cloning the master channel,
and then triggering a download of the SDK dependencies:

```terminal
$ git clone -b master https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
$ ./flutter/bin/flutter --version
```

For additional details on how our installation bundles are structured, see
[Installation
bundles](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-Installation-Bundles).
