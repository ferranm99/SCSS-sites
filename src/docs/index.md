Flutter 1.7 is live!

For more information, see [Announcing Futter
1.7]({{site.flutter-medium}}/announcing-flutter-1-7-9cab4f34eacf)
on the [Flutter Medium Publication]({{site.flutter-medium}}).
{% comment %} Not ready yet
and the [1.7 release notes]()
on the [Flutter wiki]({{site.github}}//flutter/flutter/wiki).
{% endcomment %}

New and updated docs on the site include:

* The [Preparing an Android app for release](/docs/deployment/android)
  page is updated to discuss how to build an Android release
  using an app bundle, as well as how to create separate APK
  files for both 32-bit and 64-bit devices.
* The [DevTools](/docs/development/tools/devtools) docs are migrated
  to flutter.dev. If you haven't tried this browser-based suite
  of debugging, performance, memory, and inspection tools that
  work with both Flutter and Dart apps and can be launched from
  Android Studio/IntelliJ _and_ VS Code, please check it out!
* The [Simple app state
  management](/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple)
  page is updated. The example code in the page now uses the 3.0
  release of the Provider package.
* A new animation recipe, [Animate a page route
  transition](/docs/cookbook/animation/page-route-animation)
  has been added to the [Cookbook](/docs/cookbook).
* The [Debugging](/docs/testing/debugging), 
  [Flutter's build modes](/docs/testing/build-modes),
  [Performance best practices](/docs/testing/best-practices), and
  [Performance profiling](/docs/testing/ui-performance)
  pages are updated to reflect DevTools. A
  [Debugging apps programmatically](/docs/testing/code-debugging)
  page has also been added.

The Flutter 1.7 release includes the new
[RangeSlider]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/RangeSlider-class.html)
component, which allows the user to select both the upper and lower
endpoints in a range of values. Look for an article later this week
on the [Flutter Medium Publication]({{site.flutter-medium}})
about this new component and how to customize it.

Happy Fluttering!
