**Sept 10, 2019**

Flutter 1.9 is live!

For more information, see [Flutter news from GDD China: uniting Flutter on web and mobile, and introducing Flutter
1.9](https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/09/flutter-news-from-gdd-china-flutter1.9.html?m=1)
and the [1.9.1 release
notes]({{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/wiki/Release-Notes-Flutter-1.9.1).

For the 1.9 release, Flutter's web support has been
merged ("unforked") into the main repo.
**Web support hasn't reached beta, and is not ready
to be used in production.**
Web and desktop support (which is also coming), will
impact the website, which was originally written
exclusively for developing Flutter mobile apps.
Some website updates are available now (and listed below),
but more will be coming.

New and updated docs on the site include:

* The Flutter layout codelab has been rewritten and
  uses the updated DartPad, the browser-based tool for
  running Dart code. DartPad now supports Flutter!
  [Try it out](/docs/codelabs/layout-basics)
  and let us know what you think.
* A new page on [using the dart:ffi
  library](/docs/development/platform-integration/c-interop)
  to bind your app to native code (a feature currently under
  development).
* The Performance view tool, which allows you to record
  and profile a session from your Dart/Flutter application,
  has been enabled in DevTools. For more information,
  see the [Performance
  view](/docs/development/tools/devtools/performance)
  page.
* A new page on
  [building a web application](/docs/get-started/web).
* A new page on [creating responsive
  apps](/docs/development/ui/layout/responsive)
  in Flutter.
* A new page on
  [preparing a web app for release](/docs/deployment/web).
* A new [web FAQ](/docs/development/platform-integration/web).
* The [Flutter for web](/web) page is updated.

Other relevant docs:

* Error messages have been improved in SDK 1.9.
  For more information, read [Improving Flutter's
  Error Messages](https://medium.com/flutter/improving-flutters-error-messages-e098513cecf9)
  on the [Flutter Medium publication](https://medium.com/flutter).
* If you already have a web app that depends on the
  flutter_web package, the following instructions tell
  you how to migrate to the flutter package:
  [Upgrading from package:flutter_web to the Flutter
  SDK](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Upgrading-from-package:flutter_web-to-the-Flutter-SDK).
* A new [ToggleButtons]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/ToggleButtons-class.html)
  widget, described in the API docs.
  [ToggleButtons demo]({{site.github}}/csells/flutter_toggle_buttons)
* A new [ColorFiltered]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/ColorFiltered-class.html)
  widget, also described in the API docs.
  [ColorFiltered demo]({{site.github}}/csells/flutter_color_filter)
* New behavior for the
  [SelectableText]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/SelectableText-class.html)
  widget.

Happy Fluttering!
