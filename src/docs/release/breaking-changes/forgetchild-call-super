title: Element subclasses must call super in forgetChild
description: Any element subclasses that override forgetChild will require to call super.
---

## Summary

A recent global key duplication detection refactor requires `Element` subclasses that override
the `forgetChild` to call super.

## Context

When we encounter a global key duplication which will be cleaned up by an element rebuild later, we
must not report global key duplication. Our previous implementation throws error as soon as we detect
such duplication and does not wait for the rebuild if the element with duplicated global key will
rebuild. The current implementation will keep track all the global key duplications during a build 
cycle and only verify global key duplication at the end of the that cycle instead of throwing error
immediately. As part of the refactoring, we implemented a mechanism to remove previous global key
duplication in forgetChild if the rebuild has happened. This, however, requires all Element
subclasses that override the forgetChild to call the super method.

## Description of change

The `forgetChild` of abstract class `Element` has a base implementation to remove global key reservation,
and it is enforced by `@mustCallSuper` meta tag. All the subclasses that override the method have to call
super; otherwise, analyzer will show linting error and global key duplication detection might throw
unexpected error.

## Migration guide

In the following example, an app's `Element` subclass overrode the `forgetChild` method

Code before migration:

<!-- skip -->
```dart
class CustomElement extends Element {

    @override
    void forgetChild(Element child) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Code after migration:

<!-- skip -->
```dart
class CustomElement extends Element {

    @override
    void forgetChild(Element child) {
        ...
        super.forgetChild(child);
    }
}
```
