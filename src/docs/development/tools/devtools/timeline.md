title: Using the Timeline view
description: Learn how to use the DevTools timeline view.

{{site.alert.note}}
  The timeline view works with Dart CLI and mobile apps only.
  Use Chrome DevTools to [generate timeline events][]
  for a web app.

## What is it?

The timeline view offers timing and performance information for activity in your
application. It consists of three parts, each increasing in granularity.

* Flutter frames chart (Flutter apps only)
* Timeline events chart
* CPU profiler

{{site.alert.note}}
  **Use a profile build of your application to analyze performance.**
  Frame rendering times are not indicative of release performance
  unless your application is run in profile mode.
{{site.alert.end}}

The timeline view also supports importing and exporting of
timeline data files. For more information,
see the [Import and export][] section.

## Flutter frames chart

This chart contains Flutter frame information for your application. Each bar set
in the chart represents a single Flutter frame. The bars are color-coded to
highlight the different portions of work that occur when rendering a Flutter
frame: work from the UI thread and work from the raster thread (previously known
as the GPU thread).

Selecting a bar from this chart centers the flame chart below on the timeline
events corresponding to the selected Flutter frame. The events are highlighted
with blue brackets.

### UI

The UI thread executes Dart code in the Dart VM. This includes
code from your application as well as the Flutter framework.
When your app creates and displays a scene, the UI thread creates
a layer tree, a lightweight object containing device-agnostic
painting commands, and sends the layer tree to the raster thread
to be rendered on the device. Do **not** block this thread.

### Raster

The raster thread (previously known as the GPU thread) executes 
graphics code from the Flutter Engine.
This thread takes the layer tree and displays it by talking to
the GPU (graphic processing unit). You cannot directly access
the raster thread or its data, but if this thread is slow, it's a
result of something you've done in the Dart code. Skia, the
graphics library, runs on this thread.

Sometimes a scene results in a layer tree that is easy to construct,
but expensive to render on the raster thread. In this case, you
need to figure out what your code is doing that is causing
rendering code to be slow. Specific kinds of workloads are more
difficult for the GPU. They might involve unnecessary calls to
`saveLayer()`, intersecting opacities with multiple objects,
and clips or shadows in specific situations.

For more information on profiling, see
[Identifying problems in the GPU graph][GPU graph].

### Jank

The frame rendering chart shows jank with a red overlay.
A frame is considered to be janky if it takes more than
~16 ms to complete (for 60 FPS devices). To achieve a frame rendering rate of
60 FPS (frames per second), each frame must render in
~16 ms or less. When this target is missed, you may
experience UI jank or dropped frames.

For more information on how to analyze your app's performance,
see [Flutter performance profiling][].

## Timeline events chart

The timeline events chart shows all event trace from your application.
The Flutter framework emits timeline events as it works to build frames, draw
scenes, and track other activity such as HTTP traffic. These events show up here
in the Timeline. You can also send your own Timeline events via the
dart:developer
[Timeline](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-developer/Timeline-class.html)
and [TimelineTask](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-developer/TimelineTask-class.html)
APIs.

The flame chart supports zooming and panning:
* To zoom, scroll up and down with the mouse wheel / trackpad
* To pan horizontally, either click and drag the chart or scroll horizontally
with the mouse wheel / trackpad
* To pan vertically, either click and drag the chart or use **alt + scroll**
* The WASD keys also work for controlling zoom and horizontal scroll position

You can click an event to view CPU profiling information in the CPU profiler
below, described in the next section.

## CPU profiler

This section shows CPU profiling information for a specific event
from the frame events chart (Build, Layout, Paint, etc).

### Profile granularity

The default rate at which the VM collects CPU samples is 1 sample / 250 μs.
This is selected by default on the Timeline view as "Profile granularity: medium".
This rate can be modified via the selector at the top of the page. The sampling rates
for low, medium, and high granularity are 1 / 50 μs, 1 / 250 μs, and 1 / 1000 μs,
respectively. It is important to know the trade-offs of modifying this setting.

A **higher granularity** profile has a higher sampling rate, and therefore yields
a fine-grained CPU profile with more samples. This may also impact performance of
your app since the VM is being interrupted more often to collect samples.
This also causes the VM's CPU sample buffer to overflow more quickly. The VM has
limited space where it can store CPU sample information. At a higher sampling
rate, the space fills up and begins to overflow sooner than it would have if a
lower sampling rate was used. This means that you may not have access to CPU samples
for frames in the beginning of the timeline.

A **lower granularity** profile has a lower sampling rate, and therefore
yields a coarse-grained CPU profile with fewer samples. However, this impacts your
app's performance less. The VM's sample buffer also fills more slowly, so you can see
CPU samples for a longer period of app run time. This means that you have a better
chance of viewing CPU samples from earlier frames in the timeline.

### Flame chart

This tab of the profiler shows CPU samples for the selected frame
event (such as Layout in the following example). This chart should
be viewed as a top-down stack trace, where the top-most stack frame
calls the one below it. The width of each stack frame represents the
amount of time it consumed the CPU. Stack frames that consume a lot
of CPU time may be a good place to look for possible performance
improvements.

### Call tree

The call tree view shows the method trace for the CPU profile.
This table is a top-down representation of the profile,
meaning that a method can be expanded to show its _callees_.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Total time**</dt>
<dd>Time the method spent executing its own code as well as
    the code for its callees.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Self time**</dt>
<dd>Time the method spent executing only its own code.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Method**</dt>
<dd>Name of the called method.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Source**</dt>
<dd>File path for the method call site.</dd>
</dl>

### Bottom up

The bottom up view shows the method trace for the CPU profile but,
as the name suggests, it's a bottom-up representation of the profile.
This means that each top-level method in the table is actually the
last method in the call stack for a given CPU sample (in other words,
it's the leaf node for the sample).

In this table, a method can be expanded to show its _callers_.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Total time**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Time the method spent executing its own code
    as well as the code for its callee.

<dt markdown="1">**Self time**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">For top-level methods in the bottom-up tree
    (leaf stack frames in the profile), this is the time the
    method spent executing only its own code. For sub nodes
    (the callers in the CPU profile), this is the self time
    of the callee when being called by the caller.
    In the following example, the self time of the caller
    `createRenderObject` is equal to the self time of
    the callee `debugCheckHasDirectionality` when being called by
    the caller.

<dt markdown="1">**Method**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Name of the called method.

<dt markdown="1">**Source**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">File path for the method call site.

## Import and export

DevTools supports importing and exporting timeline snapshots.
Clicking the export button (upper-right corner above the
frame rendering chart) downloads a snapshot of the current timeline
state. To import a timeline snapshot, you can drag and drop the
snapshot into DevTools from any page. **Note that DevTools only
supports importing files that were originally exported from DevTools.**
