For a discussion of how to use Flutter's Navigator class with various types of routes, see the [API documentation on the Navigator class]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html).

The following [cookbook recipes cover {{page.title | downcase }}][cookbook]:

* [Navigate to a new screen and back](/docs/cookbook/navigation/navigation-basics)
* [Send data to a new screen](/docs/cookbook/navigation/passing-data)
* [Return data from a screen](/docs/cookbook/navigation/returning-data)
* [Navigate with named routes](/docs/cookbook/navigation/named-routes)
* [Animating a widget across screens](/docs/cookbook/navigation/hero-animations)
