  * How Flutter's layout mechanism works.
  * How to lay out widgets vertically and horizontally.
  * How to build a Flutter layout.
{{site.alert.end}}

This is a guide to building layouts in Flutter.
You'll build the layout for the following app:

{% include app-figure.md img-class="site-mobile-screenshot border"
    image="ui/layout/lakes.jpg" caption="The finished app" %}

This guide then takes a step back to explain Flutter's approach to layout,
and shows how to place a single widget on the screen.
After a discussion of how to lay widgets out horizontally and vertically,
some of the most common layout widgets are covered.

## Building a layout

If you want a "big picture" understanding of the layout mechanism,
start with [Flutter's approach to layout](#flutters-approach-to-layout).

### Step 0: Create the app base code

Make sure you've [set up](/docs/get-started/install) your environment,
then do the following:

 1. [Create a basic "Hello World" Flutter app][hello-world].
 2. Change the app bar title and the app title as follows:

    <?code-excerpt "codelabs/startup_namer/1-base/lib/main.dart" diff-with="layout/lakes/step0/lib/main.dart"?>
    ```diff

       Widget build(BuildContext context) {
         return MaterialApp(
    -      title: 'Welcome to Flutter',
    +      title: 'Flutter Layout Demo',
           home: Scaffold(
             appBar: AppBar(
    -          title: Text('Welcome to Flutter'),
    +          title: Text('Top Lakes'),
             ),
             body: Center(
               child: Text('Hello World'),
    ```

[hello-world]: /docs/get-started/codelab#step-1-create-the-starter-flutter-app

### Step 1: Diagram the layout

The first step is to break the layout down to its basic elements:

* Identify the rows and columns.
* Does the layout include a grid?
* Are there overlapping elements?
* Does the UI need tabs?
* Notice areas that require alignment, padding, or borders.

First, identify the larger elements. In this example, four elements are
arranged into a column: an image, two rows, and a block of text.

{% include app-figure.md img-class="site-mobile-screenshot border"
    image="ui/layout/lakes-column-elts.png" caption="Column elements (circled in red)" %}

Next, diagram each row. The first row, called the Title
section, has 3 children: a column of text, a star icon,
and a number. Its first child, the column, contains 2 lines of text.
That first column takes a lot of space, so it must be wrapped in an
Expanded widget.

{% include app-figure.md image="ui/layout/title-section-parts.png" alt="Title section" %}

The second row, called the Button section, also has
3 children: each child is a column that contains an icon and text.

{% include app-figure.md image="ui/layout/button-section-diagram.png" alt="Button section" %}

Once the layout has been diagrammed, it's easiest to take a bottom-up
approach to implementing it. To minimize the visual
confusion of deeply nested layout code, place some of the implementation
in variables and functions.

### Step 2: Implement the title row

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes/step2"?>

First, you'll build the left column in the title section. Add the following code
at the top of the `build()` method of the `MyApp` class:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (titleSection)" title?>
```dart
Widget titleSection = Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(32.0),
  child: Row(
    children: [
      Expanded(
        /*1*/
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            /*2*/
            Container(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 8.0),
              child: Text(
                'Oeschinen Lake Campground',
                style: TextStyle(
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                ),
              ),
            ),
            Text(
              'Kandersteg, Switzerland',
              style: TextStyle(
                color: Colors.grey[500],
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      /*3*/
      Icon(
        Icons.star,
        color: Colors.red[500],
      ),
      Text('41'),
    ],
  ),
);
```

{:.numbered-code-notes}
 1. Putting a Column inside an Expanded widget stretches the column to use all
    remaining free space in the row. Setting the `crossAxisAlignment` property to
    `CrossAxisAlignment.start` positions the column at the start of the row.
 2. Putting the first row of text inside a Container enables you to add padding.
    The second child in the Column, also text, displays as grey.
 3. The last two items in the title row are a star icon, painted red,
    and the text "41". The entire row is in a Container and padded
    along each edge by 32 pixels.

Add the title section to the app body like this:

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes"?>
<?code-excerpt "step0/lib/main.dart" diff-with="step2/lib/main.dart" from="return MaterialApp"?>

  - When pasting code into your app, indentation can
    become skewed. You can fix this in your Flutter editor
    using the [automatic reformatting support](/docs/development/tools/formatting).
  - For a faster development experience, try Flutter's [hot reload][] feature.
  - If you have problems, compare your code to [lib/main.dart][].

{{site.alert.end}}

### Step 3: Implement the button row

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes/step3"?>

The button section contains 3 columns that use the same layout&mdash;an
icon over a row of text. The columns in this row are evenly spaced,
and the text and icons are painted with the primary color.

Since the code for building each row is almost identical, create a private
helper method named `buildButtonColumn()`, which takes a color, an Icon and
Text, and returns a column with its widgets painted in the given color.

<!-- skip -->
<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (_buildButtonColumn)" title?>
```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // ···
  }

  Column _buildButtonColumn(Color color, IconData icon, String label) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Icon(icon, color: color),
        Container(
          margin: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 8.0),
          child: Text(
            label,
            style: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 12.0,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.w400,
              color: color,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

The function adds the icon directly to the column. The text is inside a
Container with a top-only margin, separating the text from the icon.

Build the row containing these columns by calling the function and passing the
[Icon][] and text specific to that column. Align the columns along the main axis
using `MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly` to arrange the free space evenly before,
between, and after each column. Add the following code just below the
`titleSection` declaration inside the `build()` method:

<!-- skip -->
<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (buttonSection)" title?>
```dart
Color color = Theme.of(context).primaryColor;

Widget buttonSection = Container(
  child: Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
    children: [
      _buildButtonColumn(color, Icons.call, 'CALL'),
      _buildButtonColumn(color, Icons.near_me, 'ROUTE'),
      _buildButtonColumn(color, Icons.share, 'SHARE'),
    ],
  ),
);
```

Add the button section to the body:

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes"?>
<?code-excerpt "step2/lib/main.dart" diff-with="step3/lib/main.dart" from="return MaterialApp" to="}"?>
```diff

           ],
         ),
       ),
     );
   }
```

### Step 4: Implement the text section

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes/step4"?>

Define the text section as a variable. Put the text in a Container and add
padding along each edge. Add the following code just below the `buttonSection`
declaration:

<!-- skip -->
<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (textSection)" title?>
```dart
Widget textSection = Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(32.0),
  child: Text(
    'Lake Oeschinen lies at the foot of the Blüemlisalp in the Bernese '
        'Alps. Situated 1,578 meters above sea level, it is one of the '
        'larger Alpine Lakes. A gondola ride from Kandersteg, followed by a '
        'half-hour walk through pastures and pine forest, leads you to the '
        'lake, which warms to 20 degrees Celsius in the summer. Activities '
        'enjoyed here include rowing, and riding the summer toboggan run.',
    softWrap: true,
  ),
);
```

By setting `softwrap` to true, text lines will fill the column width before
wrapping at a word boundary.

Add the text section to the body:

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes"?>

### Step 5: Implement the image section

Three of the four column elements are now complete, leaving only the image.
Add the image file to the example:

* Create an `images` directory at the top of the project.
* Add [`lake.jpg`]({{rawExFile}}/layout/lakes/step5/images/lake.jpg).

  {{site.alert.info}}
    Note that `wget` doesn't work for saving this binary file. The original image
    is [available online][] under a Creative Commons license, but it's large and
    slow to fetch.

`BoxFit.cover` tells the framework that the image should be as small as
possible but cover its entire render box.

### Step 6: Final touch

In this final step, arrange all of the elements in a `ListView`, rather than a
`Column`, because a `ListView` supports app body scrolling when the app is run
on a small device.

## Flutter's approach to layout

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What's the point?</h4>

  * Widgets are classes used to build UIs.
  * Widgets are used for both layout and UI elements.
  * Compose simple widgets to build complex widgets.
{{site.alert.end}}

The core of Flutter's layout mechanism is widgets. In Flutter, almost
everything is a widget&mdash;even layout models are widgets.
The images, icons, and text that you see in a Flutter app  are all widgets.
But things you don't see are also widgets, such as the rows, columns,
and grids that arrange, constrain, and align the visible widgets.

You create a layout by composing widgets to build more complex widgets.
For example, the first screenshot below shows 3 icons with a label under each one:

<div class="row mb-4">
  <div class="col-12 text-center">
    {% asset ui/layout/lakes-icons.png class="border mt-1 mb-1 mw-100" alt="Sample layout" %}
    {% asset ui/layout/lakes-icons-visual.png class="border mt-1 mb-1 mw-100" alt="Sample layout with visual debugging" %}
  </div>
</div>

The second screenshot displays the visual layout, showing a row of
3 columns where each column contains an icon and a label.

{{site.alert.note}}
  Most of the screenshots in this tutorial are displayed with
  `debugPaintSizeEnabled` set to true so you can see the visual layout.
  For more information, see
  [Visual debugging](/docs/testing/debugging#visual-debugging), a section in
  [Debugging Flutter Apps](/docs/testing/debugging).
{{site.alert.end}}

Here's a diagram of the widget tree for this UI:

{% asset ui/layout/sample-flutter-layout.png class="mw-100" alt="Node tree" %}
{:.text-center}

Most of this should look as you might expect, but you might be wondering
about the Containers (shown in pink). Container is a widget that allows
you to customize its child widget. Use a Container when you want to
add padding, margins, borders, or background color, to name some of its
capabilities.

In this example, each Text widget is placed in a Container to add margins.
The entire Row is also placed in a Container to add padding around the row.

The rest of the UI in this example is controlled by properties.
Set an Icon's color using its `color` property.
Use Text's `style` property to set the font, its color, weight, and so on.
Columns and Rows have properties that allow you to specify how their
children are aligned vertically or horizontally, and how much space
the children should occupy.

## Lay out a widget

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What's the point?</h4>

  {% comment %}
    * Create an [Image]({{api}}/widgets/Image-class.html),
      [Icon]({{api}}/widgets/Icon-class.html),
      or [Text]({{api}}/widgets/Text-class.html) widget.
    * Add it to a layout widget, such as
      [Center]({{api}}/widgets/Center-class.html),
      [Align]({{api}}/widgets/Align-class.html),
      [SizedBox]({{api}}/widgets/SizedBox-class.html),
      or [ListView]({{api}}/widgets/ListView-class.html),
      to name a few.
    * Add the layout widget to the root of the widget tree.
  {% endcomment -%}

  * Even the app itself is a widget.
  * It's easy to create a widget and add it to a layout widget.
  * To display the widget on the device, add the layout widget to the app widget.
  * It's easiest to use
    [Scaffold]({{api}}/material/Scaffold-class.html),
    a widget from the Material Components library, which provides a default banner,
    background color, and has API for adding drawers, snack bars,
    and bottom sheets.
  * If you prefer, you can build an app that only uses standard widgets
    from the widgets library.

How do you layout a single widget in Flutter?
This section shows how to create a simple widget and display it on screen.
It also shows the entire code for a simple Hello World app.

In Flutter,
it takes only a few steps to put text, an icon, or an image on the screen.

<ol markdown="1">

<li markdown="1"> Select a layout widget to hold the object.<br>
    Choose from a variety of [layout widgets](/docs/development/ui/widgets) based
    on how you want to align or constrain the visible widget,
    as these characteristics are typically passed on to the
    contained widget.
    This example uses Center which centers its content
    horizontally and vertically.
</li>

<li markdown="1"> Create a widget to hold the visible object.<br>

{{site.alert.note}}
  Flutter apps are written in the [Dart language](https://www.dartlang.org/).
  If you know Java or similar object-oriented coding languages, Dart
  will feel very familiar. If not, you might try
  [DartPad](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartpad), an interactive Dart
  playground you can use from any browser. The
  [Language Tour](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language) provides an
  overview of the features of the Dart Language.
{{site.alert.end}}

For example, create a Text widget:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
Text('Hello World', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32.0))
{% endprettify %}

Create an Image widget:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
Image.asset('images/myPic.jpg', fit: BoxFit.cover)
{% endprettify %}

Create an Icon widget:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.red[500])
{% endprettify %}

</li>

<li markdown="1"> Add the visible widget to the layout widget.<br>
    All layout widgets have a `child` property if they take a single
    child (for example, Center or Container),
    or a `children` property if they take a list of widgets (for example,
    Row, Column, ListView, or Stack).

Add the Text widget to the Center widget:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
Center(
  child: Text('Hello World', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32.0))
{% endprettify %}

</li>

<li markdown="1"> Add the layout widget to the page.<br>
   A Flutter app is, itself, a widget and most widgets have a
   [build()]({{api}}/widgets/StatelessWidget/build.html)
   method. Declaring the widget in the app's build method displays the widget
   on the device.

   For a Material app, you can add the Center widget directly to the
  `body` property for the home page.

<!-- code/layout/hello-world/main.dart -->
<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello World', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32.0)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

{{site.alert.note}}
  The Material Components library implements widgets that follow
  [Material Design principles](https://material.io/guidelines/).
  When designing your UI, you can exclusively use widgets from the standard
  [widgets library]({{api}}/widgets/widgets-library.html),
  or you can use widgets from [Material Components]({{api}}/material/material-library.html).
  You can mix widgets from both libraries,
  you can customize existing widgets,
  or you can build your own set of custom widgets.
{{site.alert.end}}

For a non-Material app, you can add the Center widget to the app's `build()`
method:

<!-- code/layout/widgets-only/main.dart -->
<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
// This app doesn't use any Material Components, such as Scaffold.
// Normally, an app that doesn't use Scaffold has a black background
// and the default text color is black. This app changes its background
// to white and its text color to dark grey to mimic a Material app.
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      decoration: BoxDecoration(color: Colors.white),
      child: Center(
        child: Text('Hello World',
            textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40.0, color: Colors.black87)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

Note that, by default, the non-Material app doesn't include an AppBar, title,
or background color. If you want these features in a non-Material app,
you have to build them yourself. This app changes the background color to
white and the text to dark grey to mimic a Material app.

</li>

</ol>

That's it! When you run the app, you should see:

{% include app-figure.md img-class="site-mobile-screenshot border w-75"
    image="ui/layout/hello-world.png" alt="Hello World" %}

**Dart code** (Material app): [main.dart]({{code}}/layout/hello-world/main.dart)<br>
**Dart code** (widgets-only app): [main.dart]({{code}}/layout/widgets-only/main.dart)

<hr>

<a name="rows-and-columns"></a>
## Lay out multiple widgets vertically and horizontally

One of the most common layout patterns is to arrange widgets vertically
or horizontally. You can use a Row widget to arrange widgets horizontally,
and a Column widget to arrange widgets vertically.

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What's the point?</h4>

  * Row and Column are two of the most commonly used layout patterns.
  * Row and Column each take a list of child widgets.
  * A child widget can itself be a Row, Column, or other complex widget.
  * You can specify how a Row or Column aligns its children, both vertically
    and horizontally.
  * You can stretch or constrain specific child widgets.
  * You can specify how child widgets use the Row's or Column's available space.
{{site.alert.end}}

To create a row or column in Flutter, you add a list of children widgets to a
[Row]({{api}}/widgets/Row-class.html) or
[Column]({{api}}/widgets/Column-class.html) widget.
In turn, each child can itself be a row or column, and so on.
The following example shows how it is possible to nest rows or columns inside
of rows or columns.

This layout is organized as a Row. The row contains two children:
a column on the left, and an image on the right:

{% asset ui/layout/pavlova-diagram.png class="mw-100"
    alt="Screenshot with callouts showing the row containing two children" %}

The left column's widget tree nests rows and columns.

{% asset ui/layout/pavlova-left-column-diagram.png class="mw-100"
    alt="Diagram showing a left column broken down to its sub-rows and sub-columns" %}

You'll implement some of Pavlova's layout code in
[Nesting rows and columns](#nesting-rows-and-columns).

{{site.alert.note}}
  Row and Column are basic primitive widgets for horizontal
  and vertical layouts&mdash;these low-level widgets allow for maximum
  customization. Flutter also offers specialized, higher level widgets
  that might be sufficient for your needs. For example, instead of Row
  you might prefer
  [ListTile]({{api}}/material/ListTile-class.html),
  an easy-to-use widget with properties for leading and trailing icons,
  and up to 3 lines of text.  Instead of Column, you might prefer
  [ListView]({{api}}/widgets/ListView-class.html),
  a column-like layout that automatically scrolls if its content is too long
  to fit the available space.  For more information,
  see [Common layout widgets](#common-layout-widgets).
{{site.alert.end}}

### Aligning widgets

You control how a row or column aligns its children using the
`mainAxisAlignment` and `crossAxisAlignment` properties.
For a row, the main axis runs horizontally and the cross axis runs
vertically. For a column, the main axis runs vertically and the cross
axis runs horizontally.

<div class="mb-2 text-center">
  {% asset ui/layout/row-diagram.png class="mb-2 mw-100"
      alt="Diagram showing the main axis and cross axis for a row" %}
  {% asset ui/layout/column-diagram.png class="mb-2 mr-2 ml-2 mw-100"
      alt="Diagram showing the main axis and cross axis for a column" %}
</div>

The [MainAxisAlignment]({{api}}/rendering/MainAxisAlignment-class.html)
and [CrossAxisAlignment]({{api}}/rendering/CrossAxisAlignment-class.html)
classes offer a variety of constants for controlling alignment.

{{site.alert.note}}
  When you add images to your project,
  you need to update the pubspec file to access them&mdash;this
  example uses `Image.asset` to display the images.  For more information,
  see this example's [pubspec.yaml
  file]({{code}}/layout/row/pubspec.yaml),
  or [Adding Assets and Images in Flutter](/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images).
  You don't need to do this if you're referencing online images using
  `Image.network`.
{{site.alert.end}}

In the following example, each of the 3 images is 100 pixels wide.
The render box (in this case, the entire screen) is more than 300 pixels wide,
so setting the main axis alignment to `spaceEvenly` divides the free
horizontal space evenly between, before, and after each image.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-8">
  {% include includelines filename="code/layout/row/main.dart" start=40 count=8 %}
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4" markdown="1">
  {% asset ui/layout/row-spaceevenly-visual.png class="mw-100" alt="Row with 3 evenly spaced images" %}

  **Dart code:** [main.dart]({{code}}/layout/row/main.dart)<br>
  **Images:** [images]({{code}}/layout/row/images)<br>
  **Pubspec:** [pubspec.yaml]({{code}}/layout/row/pubspec.yaml)
</div>
</div>

Columns work the same way as rows. The following example shows a column
of 3 images, each is 100 pixels high. The height of the render box
(in this case, the entire screen) is more than 300 pixels, so
setting the main axis alignment to `spaceEvenly` divides the free vertical
space evenly between, above, and below each image.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-8" markdown="1">
  {% include includelines filename="code/layout/column/main.dart" start=40 count=8 %}

  **Dart code:** [main.dart]({{code}}/layout/column/main.dart)<br>
  **Images:** [images]({{code}}/layout/column/images)<br>
  **Pubspec:** [pubspec.yaml]({{code}}/layout/column/pubspec.yaml)
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4 text-center">
  {% asset ui/layout/column-visual.png class="mb-4" height="250px"
      alt="Column showing 3 images spaced evenly" %}
</div>
</div>

{{site.alert.note}}
  When a layout is too large to fit the device, a red strip appears along the
  affected edge. For example, the row in the following screenshot is too
  wide for the device's screen:

  {% asset ui/layout/layout-too-large.png class="mb-4 mw-100" alt="Overly-wide image" %}
  {:.text-center}

  Widgets can be sized to fit within a row or column by using an Expanded widget,
  which is described in the [Sizing widgets](#sizing-widgets) section below.
{{site.alert.end}}

### Sizing widgets

Perhaps you want a widget to occupy twice as much space as its siblings.
You can place the child of a row or column in an
[Expanded]({{api}}/widgets/Expanded-class.html)
widget to control widget sizing along the main axis.
The Expanded widget has a `flex` property, an integer that determines
the flex factor for a widget. The default flex factor for an Expanded
widget is 1.

For example, to create a row of three widgets where the middle widget is twice
as wide as the other two widgets, set the flex factor on the middle widget to 2:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-8">
  {% include includelines filename="code/layout/row-expanded/main.dart" start=40 count=15 %}
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4" markdown="1">
  {% asset ui/layout/row-expanded-visual.png class="mw-100"
      alt="Row of 3 images with the middle image twice as wide as the others" %}

  **Dart code:** [main.dart]({{code}}/layout/row-expanded/main.dart)<br>
  **Images:** [images]({{code}}/layout/row-expanded/images)<br>
  **Pubspec:** [pubspec.yaml]({{code}}/layout/row-expanded/pubspec.yaml)
</div>
</div>

To fix the example in the previous section where the row of 3 images was
too wide for its render box, and resulted in the red strip,
wrap each widget with an Expanded widget.
By default, each widget has a flex factor of 1, assigning one-third of
the row to each widget.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-8">
  {% include includelines filename="code/layout/row-expanded-2/main.dart" start=40 count=14 %}
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4" markdown="1">
  {% asset ui/layout/row-expanded-2-visual.png class="mw-100"
      alt="Row of 3 images that are too wide, but each is constrained to take only 1/3 of the space" %}

  **Dart code:** [main.dart]({{code}}/layout/row-expanded-2/main.dart)<br>
  **Images:** [images]({{code}}/layout/row-expanded-2/images)<br>
  **Pubspec:** [pubspec.yaml]({{code}}/layout/row-expanded-2/pubspec.yaml)
</div>
</div>

### Packing widgets

By default, a row or column occupies as much space along its main axis
as possible, but if you want to pack the children closely together,
set its `mainAxisSize` to `MainAxisSize.min`. The following example
uses this property to pack the star icons together.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-8">
  <!-- code/layout/packed/main.dart -->
  <!-- skip -->
  {% prettify dart %}
  class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      var packedRow = Row(
        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
        children: [
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.green[500]),
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.green[500]),
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.green[500]),
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),
        ],
      );

    // ...
  }
  {% endprettify %}
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4" markdown="1">
  {% asset ui/layout/packed.png class="border mw-100"
      alt="Row of 5 stars, packed together in the middle of the row" %}

  **Dart code:** [main.dart]({{code}}/layout/packed/main.dart)<br>
  **Icons:** [Icons class]({{api}}/material/Icons-class.html)<br>
  **Pubspec:** [pubspec.yaml]({{code}}/layout/packed/pubspec.yaml)
</div>
</div>

### Nesting rows and columns

The layout framework allows you to nest rows and columns inside of rows
and columns as deeply as you need. Let's look the code for the outlined section
of the following layout:

{% asset ui/layout/pavlova-large-annotated.png class="border mw-100"
    alt="Screenshot of the pavlova app, with the ratings and icon rows outlined in red" %}
{:.text-center}

The outlined section is implemented as two rows. The ratings row contains
five stars and the number of reviews. The icons row contains three
columns of icons and text.

The widget tree for the ratings row:

{% asset ui/layout/widget-tree-pavlova-rating-row.png class="mw-100" alt="Ratings row widget tree" %}
{:.text-center}

The `ratings` variable creates a row containing a smaller row of 5 star icons,
and text:

<!-- code/layout/pavlova/main.dart -->
<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //...

    var ratings = Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
      child: Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
        children: [
          Row(
            mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
            children: [
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),
            ],
          ),
          Text(
            '170 Reviews',
            style: TextStyle(
              color: Colors.black,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.w800,
              fontFamily: 'Roboto',
              letterSpacing: 0.5,
              fontSize: 20.0,
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
    //...
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

{{site.alert.tip}}
  To minimize the visual confusion that can result from heavily nested layout
  code, implement pieces of the UI in variables and functions.
{{site.alert.end}}

The icons row, below the ratings row, contains 3 columns; each column contains
an icon and two lines of text, as you can see in its widget tree:

{% asset ui/layout/widget-tree-pavlova-icon-row.png class="mw-100" alt="Icon widget tree" %}
{:.text-center}

The `iconList` variable defines the icons row:

<!-- code/layout/pavlova/main.dart -->
<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // ...

    var descTextStyle = TextStyle(
      color: Colors.black,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.w800,
      fontFamily: 'Roboto',
      letterSpacing: 0.5,
      fontSize: 18.0,
      height: 2.0,
    );

    // DefaultTextStyle.merge allows you to create a default text
    // style that is inherited by its child and all subsequent children.
    var iconList = DefaultTextStyle.merge(
      style: descTextStyle,
      child: Container(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
        child: Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
          children: [
            Column(
              children: [
                Icon(Icons.kitchen, color: Colors.green[500]),
                Text('PREP:'),
                Text('25 min'),
              ],
            ),
            Column(
              children: [
                Icon(Icons.timer, color: Colors.green[500]),
                Text('COOK:'),
                Text('1 hr'),
              ],
            ),
            Column(
              children: [
                Icon(Icons.restaurant, color: Colors.green[500]),
                Text('FEEDS:'),
                Text('4-6'),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
    // ...
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

The `leftColumn` variable contains the ratings and icons rows, as well as
the title and text that describes the Pavlova:

<!-- code/layout/pavlova/main.dart -->
<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //...

    var leftColumn = Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(20.0, 30.0, 20.0, 20.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          titleText,
          subTitle,
          ratings,
          iconList,
        ],
      ),
    );
    //...
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

The left column is placed in a Container to constrain its width.
Finally, the UI is constructed with the entire row (containing the
left column and the image) inside a Card.

The Pavlova image is from
[Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/photos/?q=pavlova&image_type=&cat=&min_width=&min_height=)
and is available under the Creative Commons license.
You can embed an image from the net using `Image.network` but,
for this example, the image is saved to an images directory in the project,
added to the [pubspec file,]({{code}}/layout/pavlova/pubspec.yaml)
and accessed using `Images.asset`. For more information, see
[Adding Assets and Images in Flutter](/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images).

    different device using the **Hardware > Device** menu. For this example, we
    recommend the iPad Pro. You can change its orientation to landscape mode using

    (without changing the number of logical pixels) using **Window > Scale**.

## Common layout widgets

Flutter has a rich library of layout widgets, but here a few of those most
commonly used. The intent is to get you up and running as quickly as possible,
rather than overwhelm you with a complete list.  For information on other
available widgets, refer to the [Widget Overview](/docs/development/ui/widgets),
or use the Search box in the [API reference docs](https://docs.flutter.io/).
Also, the widget pages in the API docs often make suggestions
about similar widgets that might better suit your needs.

The following widgets fall into two categories: standard widgets from the
[widgets library,]({{api}}/widgets/widgets-library.html)
and specialized widgets from the
[Material Components library]({{api}}/material/material-library.html).
Any app can use the widgets library but only Material apps can use the
Material Components library.

### Standard widgets

* [Container](#container): Adds padding, margins, borders, background color, or
  other decorations to a widget.
* [GridView](#gridview): Lays widgets out as a scrollable grid.
* [ListView](#listview): Lays widgets out as a scrollable list.
* [Stack](#stack): Overlaps a widget on top of another.

### Material Components

* [Card](#card): Organizes related info into a box with rounded corners and a
  drop shadow.
* [ListTile](#listtile): Organizes up to 3 lines of text, and optional leading
  and trailing icons, into a row.

### Container

Many layouts make liberal use of Containers to separate widgets with padding,
or to add borders or margins. You can change the device's background by
placing the entire layout into a Container and changing its background color
or image.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-6" markdown="1">
  <h4 class="no_toc">Summary (Container)</h4>

  * Add padding, margins, borders
  * Change background color or image
  * Contains a single child widget, but that child can be a Row, Column,
    or even the root of a widget tree
</div>
<div class="col-lg-6 text-center">
  {% asset ui/layout/margin-padding-border.png class="mb-4 mw-100"
      width="230px"
      alt="Diagram showing: margin, border, padding, and content" %}
</div>
</div>

#### Examples (Container)
{:.no_toc}

In addition to the example below,
many examples in this tutorial use Container. You can also find more
Container examples in the [Flutter
Gallery][].

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-6" markdown="1">
  This layout consists of a column of two rows, each containing 2 images.
  Each image uses a Container to add a rounded grey border and margins.
  The Column, which contains the rows of images,
  uses a Container to change the background color to a lighter grey.

  **Dart code:** [main.dart]({{code}}/layout/container/main.dart), snippet below<br>
  **Images:** [images]({{code}}/layout/container/images)<br>
  **Pubspec:** [pubspec.yaml]({{code}}/layout/container/pubspec.yaml)

      ),
    );
    //...
  }
}

### GridView

Use [GridView]({{api}}/widgets/GridView-class.html)
to lay widgets out as a two-dimensional list. GridView provides two
pre-fabricated lists, or you can build your own custom grid.
When a GridView detects that its contents are too long to fit the render box,
it automatically scrolls.

#### Summary (GridView)
{:.no_toc}

* Lays widgets out in a grid
* Detects when the column content exceeds the render box and automatically
  provides scrolling
* Build your own custom grid, or use one of the provided grids:
  * `GridView.count` allows you to specify the number of columns
  * `GridView.extent` allows you to specify the maximum pixel width of a tile
{% comment %}
* Use `MediaQuery.of(context).orientation` to create a grid that changes
  its layout depending on whether the device is in landscape or portrait mode.
{% endcomment %}

{{site.alert.note}}
  When displaying a two-dimensional list where it's important which
  row and column a cell occupies (for example,
  it's the entry in the "calorie" column for the "avocado" row), use
  [Table]({{api}}/widgets/Table-class.html) or
  [DataTable]({{api}}/material/DataTable-class.html).

### ListView

[ListView]({{api}}/widgets/ListView-class.html),
a column-like widget, automatically provides scrolling when
its content is too long for its render box.

#### Summary (ListView)
{:.no_toc}

* A specialized Column for organizing a list of boxes
* Can be laid out horizontally or vertically
* Detects when its content won't fit and provides scrolling
* Less configurable than Column, but easier to use and supports scrolling

#### Examples (ListView)
{:.no_toc}

<div class="row">

### Stack

Use [Stack]({{api}}/widgets/Stack-class.html)
to arrange widgets on top of a base widget&mdash;often an image.
The widgets can completely or partially overlap the base widget.

#### Summary (Stack)
{:.no_toc}

* Use for widgets that overlap another widget
* The first widget in the list of children is the base widget;
  subsequent children are overlaid on top of that base widget
* A Stack's content can't scroll
* You can choose to clip children that exceed the render box

#### Examples (Stack)
{:.no_toc}

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-7" markdown="1">
  {% asset ui/layout/stack.png class="mw-100" width="200px" alt="Circular avatar image with a label" %}
  {:.text-center}

  Uses Stack to overlay a Container (that displays its Text on a translucent
  black background) on top of a Circle Avatar.
  The Stack offsets the text using the `alignment` property and
  Alignments.

  **Dart code:** [main.dart]({{code}}/layout/stack/main.dart), snippet below<br>
  **Image:** [images]({{code}}/layout/stack/images)<br>
  **Pubspec:** [pubspec.yaml]({{code}}/layout/stack/pubspec.yaml)

<div class="col-lg-5" markdown="1">
  {% asset ui/layout/stack-flutter-gallery.png class="mw-100" alt="An image with a grey gradient across the top" %}
  {:.text-center}

  Uses Stack to overlay a gradient to the top of the image. The gradient
  ensures that the toolbar's icons are distinct against the image.

### Card

A Card, from the Material Components library, contains related nuggets of information
and can be composed from almost any widget, but is often used with ListTile.
Card has a single child, but its child can be a column, row, list, grid,
or other widget that supports multiple children. By default, a Card shrinks
its size to 0 by 0 pixels. You can use
[SizedBox]({{api}}/widgets/SizedBox-class.html) to
constrain the size of a card.

In Flutter, a Card features slightly rounded corners
and a drop shadow, giving it a 3D effect.
Changing a Card's `elevation`
property allows you to control the drop shadow effect.
Setting the elevation to 24.0, for example, visually lifts the Card further
from the surface and causes the shadow to become more dispersed.
For a list of supported elevation values, see
[Elevation and
Shadows](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/elevation-shadows.html)
in the [Material guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/).
Specifying an unsupported value disables the drop shadow entirely.

#### Summary (Card)
{:.no_toc}

* Implements a [Material Design
  card](https://material.io/guidelines/components/cards.html)
* Used for presenting related nuggets of information
* Accepts a single child, but that child can be a Row, Column, or other
  widget that holds a list of children
* Displayed with rounded corners and a drop shadow
* A Card's content can't scroll
* From the Material Components library
