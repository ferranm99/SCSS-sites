{{site.alert.note}}
  You might be directed to this page if the framework detects that
  your app uses a plugin based on the old Android APIs.
{{site.alert.end}}

If you don't write or maintain a Flutter plugin,
you can skip this page.

As of the 1.10.17 release, new plugin APIs are available on the
master and dev channels. The old APIs won't be immediately
deprecated, but we encourage you to migrate to the new APIs.
Over time, plugins using the old APIs might produce strange
behaviors when embedding Flutter into an Android app.
Most of the Flutter plugins provided by [flutter.dev][] have
been migrated already. (Learn how to become a
[verified publisher][] on pub.dev!) For an example of
a plugin that uses the new APIs, see the
[battery package][].

## Upgrade steps

The following instructions outline the steps for supporting the new API:

1. Update the main plugin class (`*Plugin.java`) to implement
   [`FlutterPlugin`][]. For more complex plugins, you can separate the
   `FlutterPlugin` and `MethodCallHandler` into two classes. See the next
   section, [Basic plugin][], for more details on accessing app resources with
   the latest version (v2) of embedding.
   <br><br>
   Also, note that the plugin should still contain the static `registerWith()`
   method to remain compatible with apps that don't use the v2 embedding. The
   easiest thing to do (if possible) is move the logic from `registerWith()`
   into a private method that both `registerWith()` and `onAttachedToEngine()`
   can call. Either `registerWith()` or `onAttachToEngine()` will be called, not
   both.
   <br><br>
   If you are creating channels in your `onAttachToEngine()`, there is no need
   to cleanup those creations in `onDetachFromEngine()`, and creating them again
   the second time `onAttachToEngine()` is called is fine.
   <br><br>
   In addition, you should document all non-overridden public members within the
   plugin. In an add-to-app scenario, these classes will be accessible to a
   developer and require documentation.

2. (Optional) If your plugin needs an `Activity` reference,
   also implement `ActivityAware`.

3. (Optional) If your plugin is expected to be held in a
   background Service at any point in time,
   implement `ServiceAware`.

4. Update the example app's `MainActivity.java` to use the
   v2 embedding FlutterActivity. You may have to make a
   public constructor for you plugin class if one didn't
   exist already. For example:

```java
package io.flutter.plugins.firebasecoreexample;

import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity;
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine;
import io.flutter.plugins.firebase.core.FirebaseCorePlugin;

public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
  // TODO(<github-username>): Remove this once v2 of
  // GeneratedPluginRegistrant rolls to stable.
  // https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/42694
  @Override
  public void configureFlutterEngine(FlutterEngine flutterEngine) {
    flutterEngine.getPlugins().add(new FirebaseCorePlugin());
  }
}
```

5. (Optional) Use ShimPluginRegistry to add plugins that donâ€™t yet
   support the v2 embedding. For example:

```java
ShimPluginRegistry shimPluginRegistry = new ShimPluginRegistry(flutterEngine);
PathProviderPlugin.registerWith(
        shimPluginRegistry.registrarFor("io.flutter.plugins.pathprovider.PathProviderPlugin"));
VideoPlayerPlugin.registerWith(
        shimPluginRegistry.registrarFor("io.flutter.plugins.videoplayer.VideoPlayerPlugin"));
```

6. Create an `EmbeddingV1Activity.java` file that uses the v1
   embedding in the same folder as `MainActivity`. For example:

```java
package io.flutter.plugins.firebasecoreexample;

import android.os.Bundle;
import io.flutter.app.FlutterActivity;
import io.flutter.plugins.GeneratedPluginRegistrant;

public class EmbeddingV1Activity extends FlutterActivity {
 @Override
 protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
   super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
   GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(this);
 }
}
```

7. Add the `EmbeddingV1Activity` to the
   <plugin_name>/example/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml.
   For example:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".EmbeddingV1Activity"
    android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
         android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|locale|layoutDirection|fontScale"
    android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
</activity>
```

8. To have the plugin support Flutter on branches master and stable,
    include this gradle script in <plugin_name>/android/build.gradle.

```groovy
// TODO(<github-username>): Remove this hack once androidx
// lifecycle is included on stable.
// https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/42348

afterEvaluate {
    def containsEmbeddingDependencies = false
    for (def configuration : configurations.all) {
        for (def dependency : configuration.dependencies) {
            if (dependency.group == 'io.flutter' &&
                    dependency.name.startsWith('flutter_embedding') &&
                    dependency.isTransitive())
            {
                containsEmbeddingDependencies = true
                break
            }
        }
    }
    if (!containsEmbeddingDependencies) {
        android {
            dependencies {
                def lifecycle_version = "1.1.1"
                compileOnly "android.arch.lifecycle:runtime:$lifecycle_version"
                compileOnly "android.arch.lifecycle:common:$lifecycle_version"
                compileOnly "android.arch.lifecycle:common-java8:$lifecycle_version"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing your plugin

The remaining steps address testing your plugin, which we encourage,
but aren't required.

1. Update `<plugin_name>/example/android/app/build.gradle`
   to replace references to `android.support.test` with `androidx.test`:

```groovy
defaultConfig {
   ...
  testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
  ...
}
```

```groovy
dependencies {
...
androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test:runner:1.2.0'
androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test:rules:1.2.0'
androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.2.0'
...
}
```

2. Add tests files for `MainActivity` and `EmbeddingV1Activity`
   in `<plugin_name>/example/android/app/src/androidTest/java/<plugin_path>/`.
   You will need to create these directories. For example:

```java
package io.flutter.plugins.firebase.core;

import androidx.test.rule.ActivityTestRule;
import dev.flutter.plugins.e2e.FlutterRunner;
import io.flutter.plugins.firebasecoreexample.MainActivity;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(FlutterRunner.class)
public class MainActivityTest {
  @Rule public ActivityTestRule<MainActivity> rule = new ActivityTestRule<>(MainActivity.class);
}
```

```java
package io.flutter.plugins.firebase.core;

import androidx.test.rule.ActivityTestRule;
import dev.flutter.plugins.e2e.FlutterRunner;
import io.flutter.plugins.firebasecoreexample.EmbeddingV1Activity;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(FlutterRunner.class)
public class EmbeddingV1ActivityTest {
  @Rule
  public ActivityTestRule<EmbeddingV1Activity> rule =
      new ActivityTestRule<>(EmbeddingV1Activity.class);
}
```

3. Add `e2e` and `flutter_driver` dev_dependencies to
   `<plugin_name>/pubspec.yaml` and
   `<plugin_name>/example/pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
e2e: ^0.2.1
flutter_driver:
  sdk: flutter
```

4. Manually register the E2E plugin in `MainActivity.java`
   alongside any other plugins used by the example app.

```java
package io.flutter.plugins.packageinfoexample;

import dev.flutter.plugins.e2e.E2EPlugin;
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity;
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine;
import io.flutter.plugins.packageinfo.PackageInfoPlugin;

public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
  // TODO(jackson): Remove this once v2 of GeneratedPluginRegistrant
  // rolls to stable.
  // https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/42694
  @Override
  public void configureFlutterEngine(FlutterEngine flutterEngine) {
    flutterEngine.getPlugins().add(new PackageInfoPlugin());
    flutterEngine.getPlugins().add(new E2EPlugin());
  }
}
```

4. Update minimum Flutter version of environment in
   `<plugin_name>/pubspec.yaml`. All plugins moving
   forward will set the minimum version to 1.9.1+hotfix.4
   which is the minimum version for which we can guarantee support.
   For example:

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.0.0-dev.28.0 <3.0.0"
  flutter: ">=1.9.1+hotfix.4 <2.0.0"

```

5. Create a simple test in `<plugin_name>/test/<plugin_name>_e2e.dart`.
   For the purpose of testing the PR that adds the v2 embedding support,
   we're trying to test some very basic functionality of the plugin.
   This is a smoke test to ensure that the plugin properly registers
   with the new embedder. For example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:battery/battery.dart';
import 'package:e2e/e2e.dart';

void main() {
  E2EWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  testWidgets('Can get battery level', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    final Battery battery = Battery();
    final int batteryLevel = await battery.batteryLevel;
    expect(batteryLevel, isNotNull);
  });
}
```

6. Test run the e2e tests locally. In a terminal,
   do the following:

```sh
cd <plugin_name>/example
flutter build apk
cd android
./gradlew app:connectedAndroidTest -Ptarget=`pwd`/../../test/<plugin_name>_e2e.dart

```

## Basic plugin

To get started with a Flutter Android plugin in code,
start by implementing `FlutterPlugin`.

```java
public class MyPlugin implements FlutterPlugin {
  @Override
  public void onAttachedToEngine(@NonNull FlutterPluginBinding binding) {
    // TODO: your plugin is now attached to a Flutter experience.
  }

  @Override
  public void onDetachedFromEngine(@NonNull FlutterPluginBinding binding) {
    // TODO: your plugin is no longer attached to a Flutter experience.
  }
}
```

As shown above, your plugin may or may not be associated with
a given Flutter experience at any given moment in time.
You should take care to initialize your plugin's behavior
in onAttachedToEngine(), and then cleanup your plugin's references
in onDetachedFromEngine().

The FlutterPluginBinding provides your plugin with a few
important references:

**binding.getFlutterEngine()**
: Returns the `FlutterEngine` that your plugin is attached to,
  providing access to components like the DartExecutor,
  FlutterRenderer, and more.

**binding.getApplicationContext()**
: Returns the Android application's Context for the running app.

**binding.getLifecycle()**
: Returns a reference that can be used to obtain a `Lifecycle` object.
  If you need to use this lifecycle reference then you need add a
  project dependency on Flutter's Android lifecycle package.

## UI/Activity plugin

If your plugin needs to interact with the UI,
such as requesting permissions, or altering Android UI chrome,
then you need to take additional steps to define your plugin.
You must implement the ActivityAware interface.

```java
public class MyPlugin implements FlutterPlugin, ActivityAware {
  //...normal plugin behavior is hidden...

  @Override
  public void onAttachedToActivity(ActivityPluginBinding activityPluginBinding) {
    // TODO: your plugin is now attached to an Activity
  }

  @Override
  public void onDetachedFromActivityForConfigChanges() {
    // TODO: the Activity your plugin was attached to was
    // destroyed to change configuration.
    // This call will be followed by onReattachedToActivityForConfigChanges().
  }

  @Override
  public void onReattachedToActivityForConfigChanges(ActivityPluginBinding activityPluginBinding) {
    // TODO: your plugin is now attached to a new Activity
    // after a configuration change.
  }

  @Override
  public void onDetachedFromActivity() {
    // TODO: your plugin is no longer associated with an Activity.
    // Clean up references.
  }
}
```

To interact with an `Activity`, your `ActivityAware` plugin must
implement appropriate behavior at 4 stages. First, your plugin
is attached to an `Activity`. You can access that `Activity` and
a number of its callbacks through the provided `ActivityPluginBinding`.

Since `Activity`s can be destroyed during configuration changes,
you must cleanup any references to the given `Activity` in
`onDetachedFromActivityForConfigChanges()`,
and then re-establish those references in
`onReattachedToActivityForConfigChanges()`.

Finally, in `onDetachedFromActivity()` your plugin should clean
up all references related to `Activity` behavior and return to
a non-UI configuration.
