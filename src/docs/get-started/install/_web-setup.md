## Web setup

{{site.alert.note}}
  As of 1.12, Flutter has early support for running
  web applications, but you need to be running the beta
  channel of Flutter. If you experience a problem
  that hasnâ€™t yet been reported, please [file an issue][]
  and make sure that "web" appears in the title.
{{site.alert.end}}

To prepare to run, test, and debug your Flutter app on the web,
you must [install Chrome][], if you haven't already.
