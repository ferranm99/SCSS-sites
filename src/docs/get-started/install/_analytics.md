{{site.alert.warning}}
  The `flutter` tool uses Google Analytics to anonymously report feature
  usage statistics and basic crash reports. This data is used to help
  improve Flutter tools over time. Analytics is not sent on the very
  first run or for any runs involving `flutter config`,
  so you can opt out of analytics before any data is sent.
  To disable reporting, type `flutter config --no-analytics`
  and to display the current setting,
  type `flutter config`.
