  The `flutter` tool uses Google Analytics to anonymously report
  feature usage statistics and basic crash reports. This data is
  used to help improve Flutter tools over time. 

  Flutter tool analytics are not sent on the very first run or for
  any runs involving flutter config, so you can opt out of analytics
  before any data is sent by the Flutter tool. To disable reporting,
  type `flutter config --no-analytics`, and to display the current
  setting, type `flutter config`.

  By downloading the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of 
  Service. Note: The Google [Privacy Policy][] describes how data 
  is handled in this service.

  Moreover, Flutter includes the Dart SDK, which may send usage 
  metrics and crash reports to Google.
