### Update your path

You can update your PATH variable for the current session only at
the command line, as shown in [Get the Flutter SDK](#get-sdk).
You'll probably want to update this variable permanently,
so you can run `flutter` commands in any terminal session.

The steps for modifying this variable permanently for
all terminal sessions are machine-specific.
Typically you add a line to a file that is executed
whenever you open a new window. For example:

 1. Determine the directory where you placed the Flutter SDK.
    You will need this in Step 3.
 2. Open (or create) the `rc` file for your shell.
    For example, Linux and macOS Mojave (and earlier)
    use the Bash shell by default,
    so edit `$HOME/.bashrc`.
    macOS Catalina uses the Z shell by default,
    so edit `$HOME/.zshrc`.
    If you are using a different shell, the file path
    and filename will be different on your machine.
 3. Add the following line and change
    `[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]` to be
    the path where you cloned Flutter's git repo:

    ```terminal
    $ export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
    ```

 4. Run `source $HOME/.<rc file>`
    to refresh the current window,
    or open a new terminal window to
    automatically source the file.
 5. Verify that the `flutter/bin` directory
    is now in your PATH by running:

    ```terminal
    $ echo $PATH
    ```
    Verify that the `flutter` command is available by running:

    ```terminal
    $ which flutter
    ```
