title: Security
---

The Flutter community takes the security of Flutter and the applications
it can create seriously. This page describes how to report any
vulnerabilities you may find, and collects best practices for developers
using Flutter to build their applications.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

To report vulnerabilities in Flutter itself, email us at
[product-security@google.com](mailto:product-security@google.com).
For more information about how Google handles security issues, see
[Google’s security philosophy](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/).

## Best practices

* **Keep current with the latest Flutter SDK releases.**
  We regularly update Flutter, and these updates may fix security
  defects discovered in previous versions. Check the Flutter
  [change log](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Changelog)
  for security-related updates.

* **Don’t modify your copy of Flutter.** Private, customized versions
  of Flutter tend to fall behind the current version and may not
  include important security fixes and enhancements. Instead,
  share your Flutter improvements with the community and make a pull request.
