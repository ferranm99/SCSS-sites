## What's new on flutter.io

**November 4, 2018**

Welcome to the revamped Flutter website!

We've spent the last few months redesigning the website and how its
information is organized. We hope you can more easily find the docs
you are looking for. Some of the changes to the website include:

* Revised [landing](/) page
* Revised [showcase](/showcase) page
* Revised navigation in the left side bar
* Table of contents on the right side of most pages

Some of the new content includes:

* Additional [cookbook](/cookbook) recipes
* Deep dive on Flutter internals,
  [Inside Flutter](/resources/inside-flutter)
* [Technical videos](/resources/videos) page
* How to connect [a native debugger _and_
  a Dart debugger to your app](/testing/oem-debuggers)
  (not yet complete)
* [Background Dart
  processes](development/packages-and-plugins/background-processes)
  placeholder that links to an in-depth post
  on Medium. (To be eventually replaced by actual documentation.)
* [Flutter's build modes](/testing/build-modes)

If you have questions or comments about the revamped site, [file an
issue]({{site.repo.this}}/issues).
