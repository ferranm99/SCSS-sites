This document is meant for Android developers looking to apply their
existing Android knowledge to build mobile apps with Flutter. If you understand
the fundamentals of the Android framework then you can use this document as a
jump start to Flutter development.

Your Android knowledge and skill set are highly valuable when building with
Flutter, because Flutter relies on the mobile operating system for numerous
capabilities and configurations. Flutter is a new way to build UIs for mobile,
but it has a plugin system to communicate with Android (and iOS) for non-UI
tasks. If you're an expert with Android, you don't have to relearn everything
to use Flutter.

This document can be used as a cookbook by jumping around and finding questions
that are most relevant to your needs.

# Views

## What is the equivalent of a View in Flutter

In Android, the View is the foundation of everything that shows up on the
screen. From Buttons, Toolbars, and Inputs, everything is a View.  In Flutter
the equivalent of a View is Widget. Widgets however, have a few differences
when compared with a View. To start, widgets only last for a frame, and on
every frame, Flutter's framework creates a tree of widget instances. In
comparison, on Android when a View is drawn it does not redraw until invalidate
is called.

Unlike Android’s view hierarchy system where the framework mutate Views,
Widgets in Flutter are immutable, this allows Widgets to be super lightweight.



## How do I update Widgets

In Android you update your views by directly mutating them. However,
in Flutter Widgets are immutable and are not updated directly, instead
you have to work with the Widget's state.

This is where the concept of Stateful vs Stateless widgets comes from. A
StatelessWidget is just what it sounds like, a widget with no state
information.

StatelessWidgets are useful when the part of the user interface
you are describing does not depend on anything other than the configuration
information in the object.

For example, in Android, this would be similar to just placing an ImageView
with your logo. The logo is not going to change during runtime and because
of that you would use a StatelessWidget in Flutter.

If you want to dynamically change the UI based on data received
after making an HTTP call or user interaction then you have to work
with StatefulWidget and tell the Flutter framework that the widget’s State
has been updated so it can update that widget.

The important thing to note here is at the core both Stateless and Stateful
widgets behave the same. They rebuild every frame, the difference is the
StatefulWidget has a State object which stores state data across frames and
restores it.

If you are in doubt, then always remember this rule: If a widget changes (the
user interacts with it, for example) it’s stateful. However, if a child 
is reacting to change, the containing parent can still be a Stateless widget
if the parent doesn't react to change.

Let's take a look at how you would use a StatelessWidget. A common
StatelessWidget is a Text widget. If you look at the implementation of the Text
Widget you'll find it subclasses a StatelessWidget

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
new Text(
  'I like Flutter!',
  style: new TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
);
{% endprettify %}

As you can see, the Text Widget has no state information associated with it, it
renders what is passed in it's constructors and nothing more.

But, what if you want to make "I Like Flutter" change dynamically, for
example from clicking a FloatingActionButton?

This can be achieved by wrapping the Text widget in a StatefulWidget and
updating it when the button is clicked.

For example:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  // Default placeholder text
  String textToShow = "I Like Flutter";

  void _updateText() {
    setState(() {
      // update the text
      textToShow = "Flutter is Awesome!";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text("Sample App"),
      ),
      body: new Center(child: new Text(textToShow)),
      floatingActionButton: new FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _updateText,
        tooltip: 'Update Text',
        child: new Icon(Icons.update),
      ),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}


## How do I layout my Widgets? Where is my XML layout file

In Android, you write layouts via XML, but in Flutter you write your layouts
with a widget tree.

Here is an example of how you would display a simple Widget on the screen and
add some padding to it.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text("Sample App"),
      ),
      body: new Center(
        child: new MaterialButton(
          onPressed: () {},
          child: new Text('Hello'),
          padding: new EdgeInsets.only(left: 10.0, right: 10.0),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
{% endprettify %}

You can view all the layouts that Flutter has to offer here:
[https://flutter.io/widgets/layout/](https://flutter.io/widgets/layout/)

## How do I add or remove a component from my layout

In Android, you would call addChild or removeChild from a parent to dynamically
add or remove views from a parent. In Flutter, because widgets are immutable
there is no addChild. Instead, you can pass in a function that returns a widget
to the parent and control that child's creation via a boolean.

For example here is how you can toggle between two widgets when you click on a
FloatingActionButton:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  // Default value for toggle
  bool toggle = true;
  void _toggle() {
    setState(() {
      toggle = !toggle;
    });
  }

  _getToggleChild() {
    if (toggle) {
      return new Text('Toggle One');
    } else {
      return new MaterialButton(onPressed: () {}, child: new Text('Toggle Two'));
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text("Sample App"),
      ),
      body: new Center(
        child: _getToggleChild(),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: new FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _toggle,
        tooltip: 'Update Text',
        child: new Icon(Icons.update),
      ),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}


## In Android, I can Animate a view by View.animate(), how can I do that to a Widget

In Flutter, animating widgets can be done via the animation library.

In Android you would either create animations via XML or call the .animate()
property on Views, in Flutter you can wrap widgets inside an Animation.

Like Android, in Flutter you have an AnimationController and a
Interpolator which is an extension of the Animation class, for example a
CurvedAnimation. You pass the controller and Animation into an AnimationWidget
and tell the controller to start the animation.

Let's take a look at how to write a FadeTransition that will Fade in a logo
when you press

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(new FadeAppTest());
}

class FadeAppTest extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fade Demo',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new MyFadeTest(title: 'Fade Demo'),
    );
  }
}

class MyFadeTest extends StatefulWidget {
  MyFadeTest({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);
  final String title;
  @override
  _MyFadeTest createState() => new _MyFadeTest();
}

class _MyFadeTest extends State<MyFadeTest> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  AnimationController controller;
  CurvedAnimation curve;

  @override
  void initState() {
    controller = new AnimationController(duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 2000), vsync: this);
    curve = new CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeIn);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: new Center(
          child: new Container(
              child: new FadeTransition(
                  opacity: curve,
                  child: new FlutterLogo(
                    size: 100.0,
                  )))),
      floatingActionButton: new FloatingActionButton(
        tooltip: 'Fade',
        child: new Icon(Icons.brush),
        onPressed: () {
          controller.forward();
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

## How do I use a Canvas to draw/paint

In Android, you would use the Canvas to draw custom shapes to the screen.

Flutter has two classes that will help you draw to the canvas, the CustomPaint
and CustomPainter which implements your algorithm to draw to canvas.

In this popular StackOverFlow answer you can see how
a signature painter is implemented.

See [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46241071/create-signature-area-for-mobile-app-in-dart-flutter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46241071/create-signature-area-for-mobile-app-in-dart-flutter)

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
class SignaturePainter extends CustomPainter {
  SignaturePainter(this.points);
  final List<Offset> points;
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    var paint = new Paint()
      ..color = Colors.black
      ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
      ..strokeWidth = 5.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
      if (points[i] != null && points[i + 1] != null)
        canvas.drawLine(points[i], points[i + 1], paint);
    }
  }
  bool shouldRepaint(SignaturePainter other) => other.points != points;
}
class Signature extends StatefulWidget {
  SignatureState createState() => new SignatureState();
}
class SignatureState extends State<Signature> {
  List<Offset> _points = <Offset>[];
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new GestureDetector(
      onPanUpdate: (DragUpdateDetails details) {
        setState(() {
          RenderBox referenceBox = context.findRenderObject();
          Offset localPosition =
          referenceBox.globalToLocal(details.globalPosition);
          _points = new List.from(_points)..add(localPosition);
        });
      },
      onPanEnd: (DragEndDetails details) => _points.add(null),
      child: new CustomPaint(painter: new SignaturePainter(_points)),
    );
  }
}
class DemoApp extends StatelessWidget {
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => new Scaffold(body: new Signature());
}
void main() => runApp(new MaterialApp(home: new DemoApp()));
{% endprettify %}


## How do I build custom Widgets

In Android, you would typically subclass from a View or a pre-existing
Widget to override and implement methods.

In Flutter building a custom widget is often accomplished by not extending but
composing smaller widgets.

Let's take a look at how to build a CustomButton that takes in the label in the
constructor. This is achieved by composing it with a RaisedButton, rather than
extending the RaisedButton and overriding and implementing new methods:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class CustomButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String label;
  CustomButton(this.label);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new RaisedButton(onPressed: () {}, child: new Text(label));
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

Then you can use this CustomButton just like you would with any other Widget:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Center(
      child: new CustomButton("Hello"),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

# Intents

## What is the equivalent of an Intent in Flutter

In Android, there are two main use cases for Intents: switching between
Activities, and invoking external components. Flutter on the other hand does
not have the concept of Intents, though if needed Flutter can trigger Intents
through native integration.

To switch between screens in Flutter you can access the router to draw
a new Widget.  There are two core concepts and classes for managing many
screens: Route and Navigator. A Route is an abstraction for a “screen” or
“page” of an app (think Activity), and a Navigator is a widget that manages
routes. A Navigator can push and pop routes to help a user move from screen to
screen.

Like Android where you can declare your Activities inside the
AndroidManifest.xml, in Flutter you can pass in a Map of named routes to the
top level MaterialApp instance

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
 void main() {
  runApp(new MaterialApp(
    home: new MyAppHome(), // becomes the route named '/'
    routes: <String, WidgetBuilder> {
      '/a': (BuildContext context) => new MyPage(title: 'page A'),
      '/b': (BuildContext context) => new MyPage(title: 'page B'),
      '/c': (BuildContext context) => new MyPage(title: 'page C'),
    },
  ));
}
{% endprettify %}
Then you can change to this route by getting an hold of the Navigator and
calling this named route.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/b');
{% endprettify %}

The other popular use-case for Intents is to call external components such as a
Camera or File picker. For this, you would need to create a native platform
integration (or use an existing library)

See [Flutter Plugins] to learn how to build a native platform integration.



## How do I handle incoming Intents from external applications in Flutter

Flutter can handle incoming intents from Android by directly talking to the
Android layer and requesting the data that was shared.

In this example we are registering a text share intent, so other apps
can share text to our Flutter app.

The basic flow of this application would be we first handle the shared text
data on Android's side, and then wait till Flutter requests for the data to
send it via a MethodChannel.

First we register the intent we want to handle in AndroidManifest.xml

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify xml %}
     <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTop"
            android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
            android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|locale|layoutDirection"
            android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
            android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
            <!-- This keeps the window background of the activity showing
                 until Flutter renders its first frame. It can be removed if
                 there is no splash screen (such as the default splash screen
                 defined in @style/LaunchTheme). -->
            <meta-data
                android:name="io.flutter.app.android.SplashScreenUntilFirstFrame"
                android:value="true" />
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
            </intent-filter>
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <data android:mimeType="text/plain" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
{% endprettify %}

Then in MainActivity you can handle the intent, once we get the shared text
data from the intent, we hold onto it till Flutter requests for it when it's
all ready to go.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify java %}
package com.yourcompany.shared;

import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.Bundle;

import java.nio.ByteBuffer;

import io.flutter.app.FlutterActivity;
import io.flutter.plugin.common.ActivityLifecycleListener;
import io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodCall;
import io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodChannel;
import io.flutter.plugins.GeneratedPluginRegistrant;

public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
    String sharedText;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(this);
        Intent intent = getIntent();
        String action = intent.getAction();
        String type = intent.getType();

        if (Intent.ACTION_SEND.equals(action) && type != null) {
            if ("text/plain".equals(type)) {
                handleSendText(intent); // Handle text being sent
            }
        }

        new MethodChannel(getFlutterView(), "app.channel.shared.data").setMethodCallHandler(new MethodChannel.MethodCallHandler() {
            @Override
            public void onMethodCall(MethodCall methodCall, MethodChannel.Result result) {
                if (methodCall.method.contentEquals("getSharedText")) {
                    result.success(sharedText);
                    sharedText = null;
                }
            }
        });
    }


    void handleSendText(Intent intent) {
        sharedText = intent.getStringExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT);
    }
}
{% endprettify %}

Lastly, in Flutter you can request the data when the the Flutter view is
rendered.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample Shared App Handler',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  static const platform = const MethodChannel('app.channel.shared.data');
  String dataShared = "No data";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    getSharedText();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(body: new Center(child: new Text(dataShared)));
  }

  getSharedText() async {
    var sharedData = await platform.invokeMethod("getSharedText");
    if (sharedData != null) {
      setState(() {
        dataShared = sharedData;
      });
    }
  }
}
{% endprettify %}



## What is the equivalent of startActivityForResult

The Navigator class which handles all Routing in Flutter can be used to get a
result back from a route that you have pushed on the stack. This can be done by
await'ing on the Future returned by push. For example if you were to start a
location route which let the user select their location, you could do:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
Map coordinates = await Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/location');
{% endprettify %}

then inside your location route once the user has selected their location you
can "pop" the stack with the result

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
Navigator.of(context).pop({"lat":43.821757,"long":-79.226392});
{% endprettify %}

# Async UI

## What is the equivalent of runOnUiThread in Flutter

Dart is a single-threaded execution model, with support for Isolates
(a way to run Dart code on another thread), an event loop,
and asynchronous programming. Unless you spawn an Isolate,
your Dart code runs in the main UI thread and is driven by an event loop.

For example, you can run network code on the UI thread without causing the UI
to hang:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
loadData() async {
  String dataURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
  http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
  setState(() {
    widgets = JSON.decode(response.body);
  });
}
{% endprettify %}

To update the UI you would call setState which would trigger the build method
to run again and update the data.

Here is the full example of loading data asynchronously and displaying it in a
ListView:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List widgets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    loadData();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
        appBar: new AppBar(
          title: new Text("Sample App"),
        ),
        body: new ListView.builder(
            itemCount: widgets.length,
            itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int position) {
              return getRow(position);
            }));
  }

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return new Padding(
        padding: new EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
        child: new Text("Row ${widgets[i]["title"]}")
    );
  }

  loadData() async {
    String dataURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
    http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
    setState(() {
      widgets = JSON.decode(response.body);
    });
  }
}
{% endprettify %}



## What is the equivalent of an AsyncTask or IntentService on Android

In Android, when you want to access a network resource you would
typically spawn an AsyncTask that would run code outside of the UI thread
to prevent your UI from blocking. The AsyncTask has a thread pool that manages
the threads for you.

Since Flutter is single threaded and runs an event loop (like Node.js), you
don't have to worry about thread management or spawing AsyncTasks or IntentServices.

To run code asynchronously you can declare the function as an async function
and await on long running tasks in the function

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
loadData() async {
  String dataURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
  http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
  setState(() {
    widgets = JSON.decode(response.body);
  });
}
{% endprettify %}

This is how you would typically do network or database calls.

On Android, when you extend AsyncTask, you typically override 3 methods,
OnPreExecute, doInBackground and onPostExecute. There is no equivalent to this
pattern in Flutter since you would just await on a long running function and
Dart's event loop will take care of the rest.

However, there are times where you may be processing a large amount of data and
your UI could hang.

In this case, like AsyncTask, in Flutter it is possible to take advantage of
multiple CPU cores to do long running or computationally intensive tasks. This
is done by using Isolates.

Isolates are a separate execution thread that runs and do not share any memory
with the main execution memory heap. This means you can’t access variables from
the main thread or update your UI by calling setState.

Let's see an example of a simple Isolate and how you can communicate and share
data back to the main thread to update your UI.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
  loadData() async {
    ReceivePort receivePort = new ReceivePort();
    await Isolate.spawn(dataLoader, receivePort.sendPort);

    // The 'echo' isolate sends it's SendPort as the first message
    SendPort sendPort = await receivePort.first;

    List msg = await sendReceive(sendPort, "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");

    setState(() {
      widgets = msg;
    });
  }

// the entry point for the isolate
  static dataLoader(SendPort sendPort) async {
    // Open the ReceivePort for incoming messages.
    ReceivePort port = new ReceivePort();

    // Notify any other isolates what port this isolate listens to.
    sendPort.send(port.sendPort);

    await for (var msg in port) {
      String data = msg[0];
      SendPort replyTo = msg[1];

      String dataURL = data;
      http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
      // Lots of JSON to parse
      replyTo.send(JSON.decode(response.body));
    }
  }

  Future sendReceive(SendPort port, msg) {
    ReceivePort response = new ReceivePort();
    port.send([msg, response.sendPort]);
    return response.first;
  }
{% endprettify %}

"dataLoader" is the Isolate that runs in its own seperate execution thread,
where you can do more CPU intensive processing, for example parsing a lot of
JSON - 10k+ lines, or doing computationally intensive math.

A full example that you can run is below.

## What is the equivalent of OkHttp on Flutter

Making a network call in Flutter is easy when you use the popular "http" package.

While the http package does not have all the features OkHttp has implemented,
the "http" package abstracts away a lot of the networking that you would normally
implement yourself, making it a simple way to make network calls.

[https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/http](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/http)

You can use it by adding it to your dependencies in pubspec.yaml

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify yaml %}
dependencies:
  ...
  http: '>=0.11.3+12'
{% endprettify %}

Then to make a network call, for example to this JSON GIST on GitHub you can call:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
[...]
  loadData() async {
    String dataURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
    http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
    setState(() {
      widgets = JSON.decode(response.body);
    });
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

Once you have the result you can tell Flutter to update its state by calling
setState, which will update your UI with the result from your network call.

## How do I show progress indicator in Flutter when there is a task that is
running

In Android you would typically show a progress indicator when you execute
a long running task.

In Flutter this can be done by rendering a Progress Indicator widget. You can
show the Progress Indicator programmatically by controlling when its rendered
through a boolean and telling Flutter to update it's state before your long running task.

In the example below, we break up the build function into three different
functions. If showLoadingDialog is true (when widgets.length == 0) then we
render the ProgressIndicator, else we render the ListView with all the data.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List widgets = [];

  @override

    super.initState();
    loadData();
  }

  showLoadingDialog() {
    if (widgets.length == 0) {
      return true;
    }

    return false;
  }

  getBody() {
    if (showLoadingDialog()) {
      return getProgressDialog();
    } else {
      return getListView();
    }

    return new Scaffold(
        appBar: new AppBar(
          title: new Text("Sample App"),
        ),
        body: getBody());
  }

  ListView getListView() => new ListView.builder(
      itemCount: widgets.length,
      itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int position) {
        return getRow(position);
      });

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return new Padding(padding: new EdgeInsets.all(10.0), child: new Text("Row ${widgets[i]["title"]}"));
  }

  loadData() async {
    String dataURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";

# Project Structure & Resources

## Where do I store my resolution dependent image files? HDPI/XXHDPI

Flutter follows a simple 3 resolution format like iOS. 1x, 2x, and 3x.

Create a folder called images and for each of your image files, generate a @2x
and @3x variant and place them in the folder like such

- …/my_icon.png

- …/2.0x/my_icon.png
- …/3.0x/my_icon.png

Then you would need to declare these images in your pubspec.yaml file

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify yaml %}
assets:
 - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
 - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
     {% endprettify %}

You can then access your images using AssetImage

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
return new AssetImage("images/a_dot_burr.jpeg");
{% endprettify %}

## Where do I store strings? How do I store different locales

At the moment, best practice is to create a class called Strings, for example

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class Strings{
  static String welcomeMessage = "Welcome To Flutter";
}
{% endprettify %}

Then in your code, you can access your Strings as such

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
 new Text(Strings.welcomeMessage)
{% endprettify %}

Flutter has basic support for accessibility on Android, though this feature is
a work in progress.

Flutter developers are encouraged to use the [intl
package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/intl) for internationalization and
localization.

## What is the equivalent of a Gradle file to add my external dependencies

In Android, you add dependencies by adding to your Gradle file located in your
Android project.

In Flutter while there are Gradle files under the Android folder in your
Flutter project, you would only use these if you are adding dependencies needed
for platform integration. Otherwise, you can use pubspec.yaml to declare
external dependencies specific to Flutter.

A good place to find great packages for flutter is [Pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/flutter/packages/)

# Activities and Fragments

## What are the equivalent of activities and fragments

In Android, an Activity represents a single focused thing the user can do. A
Fragment represents a way to modularize your code, build more
sophisticated user interfaces for larger screens, and help scale your
application between small and large screens. In Flutter both of these concepts
fall under the concept of a Widget.

## How do I listen to Android Activity lifecycle events

In Android you can override methods from the Activity to capture lifecycle
methods for the Activity.

In Flutter You can listen to lifecycle events by hooking into the WidgetsBinding
observer and listening to the didChangeAppLifecycleState change event.

The lifecycle events you can observe are

- resumed - The application is visible and responding to user input. This is
  onResume from Android
- inactive - The application is in an inactive state and is not receiving user
  input. This event is unused on Android and only works with iOS.
- paused - The application is not currently visible to the user, not responding
  to user input, and running in the background. This is onPause from Android
- suspending - The application will be suspended momentarily. This is unused on
  iOS



<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

class LifecycleWatcher extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LifecycleWatcherState createState() => new _LifecycleWatcherState();
}

class _LifecycleWatcherState extends State<LifecycleWatcher> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  AppLifecycleState _lastLifecyleState;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    setState(() {
      _lastLifecyleState = state;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (_lastLifecyleState == null)
      return new Text('This widget has not observed any lifecycle changes.', textDirection: TextDirection.ltr);
    return new Text('The most recent lifecycle state this widget observed was: $_lastLifecyleState.',
        textDirection: TextDirection.ltr);
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(new Center(child: new LifecycleWatcher()));
}
{% endprettify %}

# Layouts

## What is the equivalent of a LinearLayout

In Android, a LinearLayout is used to lay your widgets out linearly
-horizontally or vertically. In Flutter, you can use the Row widget or Column
widget to achieve the same result.

If you notice the two code samples are identical with the exception of the
"Row" and "Column" widget. The children are the same and this feature can be
exploited to develop rich layouts that can change overtime with the same
children.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        new Text('Row One'),
        new Text('Row Two'),
        new Text('Row Three'),
        new Text('Row Four'),
      ],
    );
  }
{% endprettify %}

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        new Text('Column One'),
        new Text('Column Two'),
        new Text('Column Three'),
        new Text('Column Four'),
      ],
    );
  }
{% endprettify %}

## What is the equivalent of a RelativeLayout

A RelativeLayout is used to lay your widgets out relative to each other. In
Flutter there are a few ways to achieve the same result.

You can achieve the result of a RelativeLayout by using a combination of
Column, Row, and Stack widgets. You can specify rules for the widgets
constructors on how the children are laid out relative to the parent.

A good example of building a RelativeLayout in Flutter is on StackOverflow
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44396075/equivalent-of-relativelayout-in
-flutter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44396075/equivalent-of-relativelayout-in-flutter)

## What is the equivalent of a ScrollView

In Android a ScrollView lets you lay your widgets such that if the users'
device has a smaller screen than your content, they can scroll.

In Flutter the easiest way to do this is using the ListView widget. This might
seem like overkill coming from Android, but in Flutter a ListView widget is
both a ScrollView and an Android ListView.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new ListView(
      children: <Widget>[
        new Text('Row One'),
        new Text('Row Two'),
        new Text('Row Three'),
        new Text('Row Four'),
      ],
    );
  }
{% endprettify %}

# Gesture Detection and Touch Event Handling

## How do I add an onClick listener to a widget in Flutter

In Android, you can attach onClick to views such as button by calling
the method 'setOnClickListener'.

In Flutter there are two ways of adding touch listeners

1. If the Widget has support for event detection you can just pass in a
  function to it and handle it. For example, the RaisedButton has an onPressed
  parameter

   <!-- skip -->
  {% prettify dart %}
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new RaisedButton(
        onPressed: () {
          print("click");
        },
        child: new Text("Button"));
  }
   {% endprettify %}

2. If the Widget does not have support for event detection, you can wrap up the
  widget in a GestureDetector and pass in a function to the onTap parameter.

   <!-- skip -->
  {% prettify dart %}
class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
        body: new Center(
      child: new GestureDetector(
        child: new FlutterLogo(
          size: 200.0,
        ),
        onTap: () {
          print("tap");
        },
      ),
    ));
  }
}
   {% endprettify %}

## How do I handle other gestures on widgets

Using the GestureDetector we can listen to a wide range of Gestures such as

- Tap

  - `onTapDown` A pointer that might cause a tap has contacted the screen at a
    particular location.
  - `onTapUp` A pointer that will trigger a tap has stopped contacting the
    screen at a particular location.
  - `onTap` A tap has occurred.
  - `onTapCancel` The pointer that previously triggered the `onTapDown` will
    not end up causing a tap.

- Double tap

  - `onDoubleTap` The user has tapped the screen at the same location twice in
    quick succession.

- Long press

  - `onLongPress` A pointer has remained in contact with the screen at the same
    location for a long period of time.

- Vertical drag

  - `onVerticalDragStart` A pointer has contacted the screen and might begin to
    move vertically.
  - `onVerticalDragUpdate` A pointer that is in contact with the screen and
    moving vertically has moved in the vertical direction.
  - `onVerticalDragEnd` A pointer that was previously in contact with the
    screen and moving vertically is no longer in contact with the screen and was
    moving at a specific velocity when it stopped contacting the screen.

- Horizontal drag

  - `onHorizontalDragStart` A pointer has contacted the screen and might begin
    to move horizontally.
  - `onHorizontalDragUpdate` A pointer that is in contact with the screen and
    moving horizontally has moved in the horizontal direction.
  - `onHorizontalDragEnd` A pointer that was previously in contact with the
    screen and moving horizontally is no longer in contact with the screen and was
    moving at a specific velocity when it stopped contacting the screen.



For example here is a GestureDetector for double tap on the FlutterLogo that
will make it rotate

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
AnimationController controller;
CurvedAnimation curve;

@override
void initState() {
  controller = new AnimationController(duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 2000), vsync: this);
  curve = new CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeIn);
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
        body: new Center(
          child: new GestureDetector(
            child: new RotationTransition(
                turns: curve,
                child: new FlutterLogo(
                  size: 200.0,
                )),
            onDoubleTap: () {
              if (controller.isCompleted) {
                controller.reverse();
              } else {
                controller.forward();
              }
            },
        ),
    ));
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

# Listviews & Adapters

## What is the alternative to a ListView in Flutter

The equivalent to a ListView in Flutter is … a ListView!

In an Android ListView, you create an adapter that you can then pass into the
ListView which will render each row with what your adapter returns. However you
have to make sure you recycle your rows , otherwise, you get all sorts of crazy
visual glitches and memory issues.

In Flutter, due to Flutters immutable widget pattern, you pass in a List of
Widgets to your ListView and Flutter will take care of making sure they are
scrolling fast and smooth.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text("Sample App"),
      ),
      body: new ListView(children: _getListData()),
    );
  }

  _getListData() {
    List<Widget> widgets = [];
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      widgets.add(new Padding(padding: new EdgeInsets.all(10.0), child: new Text("Row $i")));
    }
    return widgets;
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

## How do I know which list item is clicked on

In Android, the ListView has a method to find out which item was clicked
'onItemClickListener'. Flutter makes it easier by letting you just use the
touch handling that the widgets you passed in have.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text("Sample App"),
      ),
      body: new ListView(children: _getListData()),
    );
  }

  _getListData() {
    List<Widget> widgets = [];
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      widgets.add(new GestureDetector(
        child: new Padding(
            padding: new EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
            child: new Text("Row $i")),
        onTap: () {
          print('row tapped');
        },
      ));
    }
    return widgets;
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

## How do I update ListView's dynamically

On Android, you would update the adapter and call notifyDataSetChanged. In
Flutter if you were to update the list of widgets inside a setState(), you
would quickly see that your data did not change visually.

This is because when setState is called, the Flutter rendering engine will go
through all the widgets to see if they have changed. When it gets to your
ListView it will do a `==operator` and see that the two ListViews are the same
and nothing has changed, hence no update to the data.

To update your ListView then is to create a new List() inside of setState and
copy over all the old data to the new list. This is a simple way to achieve an
update.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List widgets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      widgets.add(getRow(i));
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text("Sample App"),
      ),
      body: new ListView(children: widgets),
    );
  }

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return new GestureDetector(
      child: new Padding(
          padding: new EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
          child: new Text("Row $i")),
      onTap: () {
        setState(() {
          widgets = new List.from(widgets);
          widgets.add(getRow(widgets.length + 1));
          print('row $i');
        });
      },
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

However the recommended, efficient, and effective way is to use a
ListView.Builder. This method is great when you have a dynamic
List or a List with very large amounts of data. This is essentially
the equivalent of using RecyclerView on Android which automatically
recycles list elements for you:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List widgets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      widgets.add(getRow(i));
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
        appBar: new AppBar(
          title: new Text("Sample App"),
        ),
        body: new ListView.builder(
            itemCount: widgets.length,
            itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int position) {
              return getRow(position);
            }));
  }

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return new GestureDetector(
      child: new Padding(
          padding: new EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
          child: new Text("Row $i")),
      onTap: () {
        setState(() {
          widgets.add(getRow(widgets.length + 1));
          print('row $i');
        });
      },
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

Instead of creating a "new ListView" we create a new ListView.builder which
takes two key parameters, the initial length of the list and an ItemBuilder
function.

The ItemBuilder function is a lot like the getView function in an Android
adapter, it takes in a position and you return the row you want rendered for
that position.

Lastly, but most important, if you notice the onTap function, we don't recreate
the List anymore and instead just .add to it.



# Working with Text

## How do I set custom fonts on my Text widgets

In Android SDK (as of Android O), you would create a Font resource file and
pass it into the FontFamily param for your TextView.

In Flutter first you need to take your font file and place in folder in your
project (best practice is to create a folder called assets).

Next in your pubspec.yaml file you would declare the fonts

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify yaml %}
fonts:
   - family: MyCustomFont
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/MyCustomFont.ttf
       - style: italic
           {% endprettify %}

and lastly you would assign the font to your Text widget

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return new Scaffold(
    appBar: new AppBar(
      title: new Text("Sample App"),
    ),
    body: new Center(
      child: new Text(
        'This is a custom font text',
        style: new TextStyle(fontFamily: 'MyCustomFont'),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
{% endprettify %}

## How do I style my Text widgets

Along with customizing fonts you can customize a lot of different styles on a
Text widget.

The style parameter of a Text widget takes a TextStyle object, where you can
customize many parameters such as

- color
- decoration
- decorationColor
- decorationStyle
- fontFamily
- fontSize
- fontStyle
- fontWeight
- hashCode
- height
- inherit
- letterSpacing
- textBaseline
- wordSpacing

# Form Input

## What is the equivalent of a "hint" on an Input

In Flutter you can easily show a "hint" or a placeholder text for your input by
adding an InputDecoration object to the decoration constructor parameter for
the Text Widget

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
body: new Center(
  child: new TextField(
    decoration: new InputDecoration(hintText: "This is a hint"),
  )
)
{% endprettify %}

## How do I show validation errors

Just like how you would with a "hint", you can pass in a InputDecoration object
to the decoration constructor for the Text widget.

However, you would not want to start off with showing an error and typically
would want to show it when the user has entered some invalid data. This can be
done by updating the state and passing in a new InputDecoration object.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  String _errorText;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text("Sample App"),
      ),
      body: new Center(
        child: new TextField(
          onSubmitted: (String text) {
            setState(() {
              if (!isEmail(text)) {
                _errorText = 'Error: This is not an email';
              } else {
                _errorText = null;
              }
            });
          },
          decoration: new InputDecoration(hintText: "This is a hint", errorText: _getErrorText()),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  _getErrorText() {
    return _errorText;
  }

  bool isEmail(String em) {
    String emailRegexp =
        r'^(([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+)*)|(\".+\"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$';

    RegExp regExp = new RegExp(p);

    return regExp.hasMatch(em);
  }
}
{% endprettify %}


# Flutter Plugins

## How do I access the GPS sensor

To access the GPS sensor you can use the community plugin
[https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/location](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/location)

## How do I access the Camera

A popular community plugin to access the camera is
[https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/image_picker](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/image_picker)

## How do I log in with Facebook

To access Facebook Connect functionality you can use
[https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_facebook_connect](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_facebook_connect) .

## How do I build my own custom native integrations

If there is platform specific functionality that Flutter or its community
Plugins are missing then you can build your own following this tutorial
[https://flutter.io/developing-packages/](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/) .

Flutter's plugin architecture in a nutshell is a lot like using an Event bus in
Android: you fire off a message and let the receiver process and emit a result
back to you, in this case the receiver would be iOS or Android.

## How do I use the NDK in my Flutter application

If you use the NDK in your current Android application and want your Flutter
application to take advantage of your native libraries then it's possible by
building a custom plugin.

Your custom plugin would first talk to your Android app, where you would be
able to call your `native` marked functions. Once a response is ready, you
would be able to send a message back to Flutter and render the result.

# Themes

## How do I theme my Material-styled app

Flutter out of the box comes with a beautiful implementation of Material
Design, which takes care of a lot of styling and theming needs that you would
typically do. Unlike Android where you declare themes in XML and then assign it
to your application via AndroidManifest.xml, in Flutter you can declare themes
via the top level widget.

To take full advantage of Material Design in your app, you can declare a top
level widget `MaterialApp` as the entry point to your application. MaterialApp
is a convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly
required for material design applications. It builds upon a WidgetsApp by
adding material-design specific functionality.

If you don't want to use Material Design, then you can declare a top level
widget `WidgetsApp` which is a convenience class that wraps a number of widgets
that are commonly required for an application

To customize the colors and styles of Material Design you can pass in a
ThemeData object to the MaterialApp widget, for example in the code below you
can see the primary swatch is set to blue and all text selection color should
be red.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        textSelectionColor: Colors.red
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}
