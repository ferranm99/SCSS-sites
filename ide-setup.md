## Flutter IDE plugins

You can write Flutter apps in a text editor, but if you desire a rich IDE experience we recommend 
using Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA. Our Flutter and Dart plugins for these IDEs support
editing, running, and debugging Flutter apps.

### Installation

You can use the plugins with the following IntelliJ platform IDEs:

* [IntelliJ CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) IDEA Community Edition (CE), version 2017.1 or later.
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) IDEA Ultimate edition, version 2017.1 or later.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), version 3.0 or later.

Both IntelliJ CE and Android Studio are free to use and supported for Flutter development.

### Installing the plugins

To use these IDEs with Flutter, you need two plugins:

  * The `Flutter` plugin powers Flutter developer workflows (running, debugging, hot reload, etc.).
  * The `Dart` plugin offers code analysis (code validation as you type, code completions, etc.).

When you install the Flutter plugin, if the Dart plugin is not already present IntelliJ
installs it for you.

To install the plugins:

1. Start IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio.
1. Open plugin preferences (**Preferences>Plugins** on macOS, **File>Settings>Plugins** on Windows & Linux).
1. Select **Browse repositoriesâ€¦**,  select the Flutter plug-in and click `install`.
1. Click `Yes` when prompted to install the Dart plugin.
1. Click `Restart` when prompted.

### Creating your first project

1. Select **File>New Project** (in IntelliJ) and then Flutter, or **File>New Flutter Project** (in Android Studio)
1. If prompted for a **Flutter SDK path**, enter the location of your SDK directory. This is the top-level `flutter`
   directory, without the `bin` subdirectory. For example, `c:\Users\obiwan\flutter` / `/Users/obiwan/flutter`.
1. Click **OK**

### Using the IDEs for Flutter

See our [additional documentation](/using-ide/) for tips on developing Flutter apps with
Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA.

## Community supported IDEs

There are number of additional IDE & editor options available enabled by
community contributions:

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dart Code plugin for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanTup.dart-code)
  offers a lightweight IDE with rich Flutter support for editing, refactoring, running, debugging, and
  hot reloading Flutter code.
  
* The Flutter terminal tool from the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.io/setup/)
  combined with a [Dart-enabled editor](https://www.dartlang.org/tools)
  provides the flexibility of your favorite editor while maintaining support
  for core Flutter development workflows.
