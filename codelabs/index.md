#### [Write Your First Flutter App, part 1](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/)

Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup
company. In part one, you'll use a package that returns pairs of words
at random and inserts them into an infinitely scrolling list.

#### [Write Your First Flutter App, part 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/)

Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup
company. In part two, you'll extend the example from part 1 to allow
the user to select favorite word pairs, and add a second "Saved Favorites"
page where users can view the selected names.
Finally, you'll change the app's theme color.

#### [Building Beautiful UIs with Flutter](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter)

A deeper "first dive" than "Write Your First Flutter App." In this codelab
you'll create a chat app that includes a simple animation, and customizes
the UI for iOS and Android.

// Right now, there's only the Java->Dart lab, which is also in the
// Flutter category, so this is (effectively) a dupe link.
For Dart-specific codelabs, see the
[codelabs](https://www.dartlang.org/codelabs) page on
[dartlang.org](https://www.dartlang.org/).
