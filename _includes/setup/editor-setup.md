## Editor setup

Using the `flutter` command-line tools, you can use any editor to develop Flutter applications.
Type `flutter help` at a prompt to view the available tools.

We recommend using our plug-ins for a [rich IDE experience](/using-ide/) 
supporting editing, running, and debugging Flutter apps. See [Editor Setup](/get-started/editor/)
for detailed steps.
