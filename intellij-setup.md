## Flutter IntelliJ IDE plugins

You can write Flutter apps in a text editor, but if you choose to work in an IDE we recommend 
IntelliJ for a [rich IDE experience](/intellij-ide/). Our Flutter and Dart plug-ins support 
editing, running, and debugging Flutter apps.

### Installing IntelliJ

You can use the IntelliJ plug-ins with one of the following JetBrains IDEs:

  * [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), Community (free) edition, version 2016.3 or later.
  * [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), Ultimate edition, version 2016.3 or later.
  * [IntelliJ WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/), version 2016.3 or later.

Android Studio (and various other JetBrains editors) is currently not supported.

### Installing the plugins

We provide two plugins:

  * The `Dart` plugin offers code analysis (code validation as you type, code completions, etc.).
  * The `Flutter` plugin powers Flutter developer workflows (running, debugging, hot reload, etc.).

To install the plugins:

1. Open plugin preferences (**Preferences>Plugins** on macOS, **File>Settings>Plugins** on Linux)
1. Select **"Browse repositoriesâ€¦"**
1. Search for `'dart'`, select the Dart plug-in and click `install` (do not restart yet).
  *  Note: this is pre-installed in WebStorm.
1. Search for `'flutter'`,  select the Flutter plug-in and click `install`. 
1. Click `Restart IntelliJ IDEA`.

### Configuring the plugins

1. Open preferences (**Preferences** on macOS, **File>Settings** on Linux)
1. Select **Languages & Frameworks>Flutter**
1. Enter, or browse to, your Flutter SDK directory path in **Flutter SDK path**
1. Click **OK**
