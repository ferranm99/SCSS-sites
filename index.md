Flutter is a new way to build high-performance, cross-platform mobile apps.
Flutter is optimized for today's, and tomorrow's, mobile devices. We are focused
on low-latency input and high frame rates on Android and iOS.

_Flutter is in technology preview._ You can build examples and demos,
but we are still working on the APIs and capabilities. We hope you
try it out and send us [feedback](mailto:flutter-dev@googlegroups.com).
