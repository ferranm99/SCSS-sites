Flutter is a new way to build high-performance, cross-platform mobile apps.
Flutter is optimized for today's, and tomorrow's, mobile devices. We are focused
on low-latency input and high frame rates on Android and iOS.

_Flutter is an early-stage open-source project._
We are still missing core features like accessibility, text input,
localisation, and more. However, you can build demos and examples
today. We hope you
try it out and send us [feedback](mailto:flutter-dev@googlegroups.com).
