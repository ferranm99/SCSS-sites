In certain cases, unit tests may depend on classes that fetch data from live
web services or databases. This is inconvenient for a few reasons:

  * Calling live services or databases will slow down test execution.
  * A passing test may start failing if a web service or database returns 
  unexpected results. This is known as a "flaky test."
  * It is difficult to test all possible success & failure scenarios using a 
  live web service or database.
  
Therefore, rather than relying on a live web service or database, we can "mock"
these dependencies. Mocks allow us to emulate a live web service or database and
return specific results depending on the situation.

Generally speaking, we can mock dependencies by creating an alternative 
implementation of a class. We can write these alternative implementations by 
hand or make use of the 
[Mockito package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mockito) as a shortcut.

This recipe demonstrates the basics of mocking using the Mockito package. 
For more information, please see the 
[mockito package documentation](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mockito).

## Directions

  1. Add the `mockito` dependency
  2. Create a function to test 
  3. Create a test file with a mock `http.Client`
  4. Write a test for each condition
  5. Run the tests

## 1. Add the `mockito` dependency

In order to use the `mockito` package, we first need to add it to our 
`pubspec.yaml` file along with the `flutter_test` dependency in the 
`dev_dependencies` section.

We'll also be using the `http` package in this example, and will define that
dependency in the `dependencies` section.

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: <newest_version>
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  mockito: <newest_version>
```

## 2. Create a function to test

In this example, we'll want to unit test the `fetchPost` function from the 
[Fetch data from the internet](/cookbook/networking/fetch-data/) recipe. In 
order to test this function, we need to make two changes:

  1. Provide an `http.Client` to the function. This will allow us to provide the
  correct `http.Client` depending on the situation. For Flutter and server-side
  projects, we can provide an `http.IOClient`. For Browser apps, we can provide 
  an `http.BrowserClient`. For tests, we will provide a mock `http.Client`.
  2. Use the provided `client` to fetch data from the internet, rather than the
  static `http.get` method, which is difficult to mock.

The function should now look like this:

<!-- skip -->
```dart
Future<Post> fetchPost(http.Client client) async {
  final response =
      await client.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // If the call to the server was successful, parse the JSON
    return Post.fromJson(json.decode(response.body));
  } else {
    // If that call was not successful, throw an error.
    throw Exception('Failed to load post');
  }
}
```

## 3. Create a test file with a mock `http.Client`

Next, we'll need to create our test file along with a `MockClient` class.
Following the advice in the 
[Introduction to unit testing](/cookbook/testing/unit-test/) recipe, we will
create a file called `fetch_post_test.dart` file in the root `test` folder. 

The `MockClient` class will implement the `http.Client` class. This will allow 
us to pass the `MockClient` to our `fetchPost` function, and allow us to return 
different http responses in each test.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Create a MockClient using the Mock class provided by the Mockito package.
// We will create a new instances of this class in each test. 
class MockClient extends Mock implements http.Client {}

main() {
  // Tests go here
}
``` 

## 4. Write a test for each condition

If we think about our `fetchPost` function, it will do one of two things:

  1. Return a `Post` if the http call succeeds
  2. Throw an `Exception` if the http call fails 

Therefore, we'll want to test these two conditions. We can use the `MockClient`
class to return an "Ok" response for the success test, and an error response 
for the unsuccessful test. 

To achieve this, we'll use the `when` function provided by Mockito.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Create a MockClient using the Mock class provided by the Mockito package.
// We will create a new instances of this class in each test.
class MockClient extends Mock implements http.Client {}

main() {
  group('fetchPost', () {
    test('returns a Post if the http call completes successfully', () async {
      final client = MockClient();

      // Use Mockito to return a successful response when it calls the
      // provided http.Client
      when(client.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1'))
          .thenAnswer((_) async => http.Response('{"title": "Test"}', 200));

      expect(await fetchPost(client), isInstanceOf<Post>());
    });

    test('throws an exception if the http call completes with an error', () {
      final client = MockClient();

      // Use Mockito to return an unsuccessful response when it calls the
      // provided http.Client
      when(client.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1'))
          .thenAnswer((_) async => http.Response('Not Found', 404));

      expect(fetchPost(client), throwsException);
    });
  });
}
``` 

### 5. Run the tests

Now that we have a `fetchPost` function with tests in place, we can run the 
tests! 

```
flutter test test/counter_test.dart
```

You can also run tests inside your favorite editor by following the instructions
in the 
[Introduction to unit testing](/cookbook/testing/unit-test/#run-tests-using-intellij-or-vscode)
recipe. 

### Summary

In this example, we've learned how to use Mockito to test functions or classes
that depend on web services or databases. This is only a short introduction to 
the Mockito library and the concept of mocking. For more information, please 
see the documentation provided by the 
[Mockito package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mockito).
